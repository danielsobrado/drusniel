# The Complete Codex: Photorealistic DnD Imagery with ChatGPT Image 1.5

---

## 1. The Architectural Paradigm Shift

### 1.1 Why Everything Changed in March 2025

DALL-E 3 was a separate diffusion model receiving a rewritten prompt through a two-system pipeline. GPT-4o generates images **autoregressively within the same transformer** using a "Transfusion" architecture — text tokens and image patches share the same embedding space. GPT Image 1.5 (December 2025) added 4× faster generation, improved dense text, and precise editing.

The practical consequence: the model genuinely **reasons about scenes** rather than pattern-matching keywords. When you write "a tiefling rogue hiding behind a crate," it creates a spatial map where the crate occludes the rogue, rather than merging them. Complex multi-element descriptions with 10–20 distinct objects maintain correct spatial relationships.

**What this means for DnD:**

- "A multi-classed Sorcerer/Paladin in heavy plate wielding a wand, with a familiar on the left pauldron" executes with high fidelity — the model separates Armor, Weapon, and Familiar tokens
- Directional instructions ("sword in left hand, shield in right") are now followed rather than overridden by training data statistics
- Negative instructions work: "a room without an elephant" actually produces a room without an elephant
- Near-perfect text rendering for scrolls, signs, and handouts

### 1.2 Latency and Real-Time Play

GPT Image 1.5 delivers outputs in **under 10 seconds** — a 4× improvement. This transforms AI from a prep-time tool to a **play-time tool**. A DM can type a description while narrating, and have the visual ready by the time the verbal description concludes. If the party burns down the tavern instead of entering it, "Burning tavern, night, panic, photorealistic" generates in seconds.

### 1.3 Competitive Landscape (Early 2026)

| Feature | GPT Image 1.5 | Midjourney v7 | Nano Banana Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Instruction Following** | Superior — strict adherence to complex grammar and spatial constraints | Moderate — prioritizes aesthetic composition over strict adherence | High — good with natural language, struggles with multi-subject separation |
| **Photorealism** | High with prompting — requires "amateur" hacks to bypass safety polish | Stylized — tends toward "digital art" or cinematic hyper-realism | High — natively leans toward glossy commercial photography |
| **Text Rendering** | Excellent — handles paragraphs, complex layouts | Weak — decorative, requires rerolls | Good — short phrases, struggles with density |
| **Editing** | Region-aware inpainting with "Drift Shield" consistency | Variant-based — good for exploration, bad for precise fixes | Global — edits shift entire image style |
| **Speed** | <10 seconds | 30–60 seconds (HQ mode) | 15–20 seconds |
| **Best For** | Consistency, control, text, iterative design, DM utility | Atmospheric mood, abstract artistic creativity | Commercial/portrait photography |

**Bottom line:** Midjourney holds the edge for pure atmospheric fantasy mood pieces. GPT Image 1.5 is the superior engine for DM utility — consistency, speed, text, and strict adherence to campaign canon.

## 2. The Optics of Fantasy: Mechanics of Photorealism

The core paradox: you're asking AI to simulate a physical camera capturing an object that doesn't exist. The default resolution is "Digital Art." Overriding this requires grounding prompts in the physics of photography and the **aesthetics of imperfection**.

### 2.1 The "Boring Reality" Aesthetic (The Samsung Protocol)

The most potent community-discovered technique rejects dramatic lighting and perfect composition in favor of **mundane everyday photography**. The theory: if an image looks "bad" (poor lighting, awkward angle, noise), the brain interprets it as "real" because manufactured images are rarely imperfect.

Specifying a **consumer-grade camera sensor** triggers the model's "amateur photography" latent space:

**Hardware keywords:** "Captured on Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra," "iPhone snapshot," "Dashcam footage," "GoPro wide angle," "Disposable camera"

**Quality indicators:** "Slight JPEG artifacts," "noise," "film grain," "chromatic aberration," "motion blur"

**Vibe descriptors:** "Boring reality," "amateur candid," "everyday aesthetic," "unpolished," "unedited," "raw footage"

**Lighting:** "Flash glare," "flat fluorescent lighting," "harsh noon sun," "overcast"

**Case study — The Orc in the Woods:**

| Approach | Prompt | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | "A terrifying orc warrior in a dark forest, cinematic lighting, 8k, highly detailed" | Beautiful glowing digital painting. The orc looks like a video game character. |
| Samsung Protocol | "A blurry, shaky smartphone photo taken from behind a tree. An Orc warrior standing in a muddy clearing, looking confused. Overcast grey sky, flat lighting, low contrast. Slightly out of focus. Captured on Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Raw realism, unpolished." | Looks like evidence. Mud looks wet and dirty, lighting is dull and oppressive, the orc looks biological. |

The paradoxical constraint **"Only create real, non-fictional images for max effect"** applied to fantasy subjects (like a goblin) causes the model to render the creature as biological reality — sebum on skin, dirt under fingernails, asymmetrical features that artistic styles usually polish away.

### 2.2 The Professional Camera Route

For **higher production value** photorealism (cinematic rather than amateur), professional camera terminology activates corresponding visual characteristics:

**Camera bodies with strongest photorealistic signal:**
- Canon EOS R5 — most cited for portraits
- Sony A7R IV — ultra-detailed, high-resolution look
- Hasselblad — medium format editorial quality
- Nikon D850 — studio portrait quality

**Film stock shortcuts:**
- Kodak Portra 400 — warm skin tones, slightly vintage, community standard for fantasy portraits
- "Shot on expired film" — introduces subtle imperfections
- "Film grain visible" — prevents the "AI perfection" uncanny valley

**The imperfection trick:** Deliberately adding flaws — "slightly out of focus background," "natural skin texture with subtle imperfections," "lens flare," "not perfectly exposed" — produces dramatically more convincing photorealism than chasing technical perfection.

### 2.3 Virtual Lens Physics as Narrative Tools

GPT Image 1.5 possesses a sophisticated understanding of optical physics. A "lens" in the prompt is not just framing — **it's a narrative tool**.

| Lens Type | Focal Length | Narrative Effect in DnD |
|---|---|---|
| **Ultra-Wide / Fisheye** | 12mm–16mm | **Disorientation/Scale.** Distorts facial features (good for monsters), expands enclosed spaces (dungeons), creates vertigo. Use for Eldritch horrors or massive cavern reveals. |
| **Wide Angle** | 24mm–35mm | **Context/Action.** Standard "smartphone" look. Keeps subject and environment in context. Ideal for combat scenes or establishing shots. |
| **Standard** | 50mm | **The Human Eye.** Neutral, undistorted. Best for "documentary" style realism. Use for NPC interactions or examining objects. |
| **Portrait** | 85mm | **Intimacy/Heroism.** Flatters facial features, separates subject from background via bokeh. Gold standard for PC portraits. |
| **Telephoto** | 200mm+ | **Compression/Voyeurism.** Compresses background against subject. Makes distant armies look massive and dense. Good for "spying" perspectives or crowded city streets. |

**Application:** To make a Beholder look truly massive and threatening, don't use a portrait lens. Use a **16mm wide-angle positioned below the creature**. This distorts the central eye, making it bulge toward the viewer, and pushes the eyestalks into the periphery, creating overwhelming scale.

---

## 3. Lighting: The Reality Anchor

Fantasy art lighting is often "impossible" — rim lights with no source, glowing weapons that don't cast shadows. Photorealism requires **Diegetic Lighting** — light originating from a physical source within the scene.

### 3.1 Lighting Types and Their DnD Applications

**Hard Light** — "Harsh shadows," "high contrast," "direct sunlight." Creates drama and tension. Good for desert encounters or high noon duels.

**Soft Light** — "Overcast," "diffused," "window light." Creates realism and texture. Good for tavern interiors or emotional scenes.

**Point Sources** — "Torchlight," "candlelight," "bioluminescence." Specifying the source helps the model calculate accurate shadow falloff.

### 3.2 The Flash Technique (Dungeon Crawling)

For dungeons, the most realistic lighting is **camera flash**, mimicking urban exploration photography:

> "A photo taken in a pitch black cave using a camera flash. The foreground (a skeleton) is brightly illuminated and harsh, fading rapidly to absolute black in the background. Harsh shadows behind the ribs."

### 3.3 Fantasy-Specific Lighting

**Dungeon/Underground:** "Torchlit," "flickering candlelight," "fire-lit with warm orange highlights and deep shadows," "bioluminescent crystal glow." Specifying the light source explicitly ("a single torch mounted on the stone wall to the left") outperforms generic "dark lighting."

**Outdoor Epic:** "Golden hour" remains the single most impactful keyword. Combine with direction: "golden hour sunlight from camera-left with soft rim light on hair."

**Volumetric lighting** — visible light rays through dust, fog, or forest canopy — is the second most powerful keyword for fantasy atmosphere.

**Character Portraits:** "Rembrandt lighting" for brooding warriors. "Rim lighting from behind" to separate characters from dark backgrounds. "Chiaroscuro" for dark fantasy contrast.

**Magical Effects:** Pair lighting with color: "pulsating arcane blue glow illuminating the caster's face from below," "sickly green necromantic energy casting shadows across the graveyard," "warm golden divine radiance streaming through stained glass."

### 3.4 Known Tint Issues

The model skews **darker** than DALL-E 3 and occasionally exhibits a yellow/orange tint. Counter with "neutral white balance" or "cool color temperature." The post-processing oversharpening artifact cannot be disabled through prompting — apply slight blur in post if needed.

## 4. The Semiotics of Prompting: Syntax and Structure

### 4.1 The 6-Component Prompt Formula

Prompts should be constructed in six distinct blocks, separated by periods or line breaks, to prevent "token bleeding" where adjectives for the background accidentally modify the subject:

1. **Subject Definition:** The core noun phrase and physical descriptors
2. **Action/State:** The verb anchoring the subject in time and physics
3. **Environment/Context:** The setting with sensory details
4. **Lighting/Atmosphere:** Specific light source and mood
5. **Technical Parameters:** Camera gear, lens, film stock
6. **Style/Quality/Constraints:** Aesthetic target and exclusions

**Example assembled:**

> "A weathered Tiefling warlock with crimson skin and curled ram horns. Reading a crumbling spell tome at a wooden desk. Inside a cluttered wizard's tower, dust motes dancing in the air, shelves filled with jars. Lit only by the faint green glow of the book's runes and a single tallow candle. Shot on 35mm film, Kodak Portra 400, 50mm lens, f/1.8 aperture, shallow depth of field. Raw realism, unedited, extremely detailed textures. No 3D render, no illustration."

### 4.2 The Markdown-Structured Prompt (Complex Environments)

For multi-element fantasy environments, **markdown formatting** significantly outperforms paragraph-style descriptions:

```markdown
# Location Art – The Ruined Chapel of Ashenvale
*A gothic stone chapel half-consumed by enchanted forest growth*

## Visual Style
- Atmospheric fantasy art, moody and cinematic
- Colors: deep greens, grey stone, amber candlelight

## Architecture
- Crumbling gothic arches overgrown with luminous vines
- Shattered stained glass windows casting colored light

## Atmosphere
- Dense fog rolling through broken doorways
- Faint magical particles drifting in the air
```

This works because it leverages GPT-4o's text-processing strength — it parses the hierarchy and treats each section as a distinct instruction set.

### 4.3 The "Paper Doll" Syntax for Equipment

To ensure correct item placement, explicitly separate layers from skin outward:

- **Layer 1 (Body):** "Male human, muscular build"
- **Layer 2 (Undergarments):** "Wearing a rough linen tunic"
- **Layer 3 (Armor):** "Wearing a rusted chainmail hauberk over the tunic"
- **Layer 4 (Accessories):** "A leather bandolier of potions across the chest"
- **Layer 5 (Hands):** "Holding a chipped wooden shield in the left hand and a mace in the right hand"

The physical hierarchy prevents chainmail merging with skin or shields merging with arms.

### 4.4 The Constraint Block (Negative Prompting)

No dedicated negative prompt field exists. Use a **constraint block** at the end of your prompt — earlier exclusions carry more weight:

**The Realism Constraint:**
> "No text, no watermarks, no signatures, no frames, no borders, no 3D render style, no illustration, no painting, no extra limbs, no distorted hands, no blurring. No cartoon, no anime, no CGI."

**The Meta Constraint** (prevents ChatGPT from rewriting your prompt):
> "Generate this image exactly as described. Do not add or modify any elements."

**Diagnostic trick:** If results seem off, ask the model to "output the exact prompt you used for this image" — this reveals where the model diverged from your intent.

### 4.5 Prompt Length Sweet Spot

**30–80 words** is optimal. Over a full paragraph causes the model to lose the thread. Under 15 words gives too much latitude. Limit to **5–7 key visual elements** per generation — add detail through iterative editing.

---

## 5. Character Architecture: Identity, Race, and Consistency

### 5.1 The "Character Anchor" Protocol

Maintaining consistency across multiple images is the holy grail. The Character Anchor defines a character by **invariant physical data** rather than subjective terms like "beautiful" or "tough" (which the AI interprets differently each time).

**Elements of a strong anchor:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Face Shape** | Square jaw, oval face, high cheekbones, sunken cheeks |
| **Hair Specs** | Short messy white hair, long braided black hair, bald with sideburns |
| **Dermatology** | Pockmarked skin, freckles across bridge of nose, scar on chin, birthmark on left cheek |
| **Ocular Details** | Heterochromia (left blue, right brown), heavy lidded eyes, wide set eyes |

**Example Anchor Block** (repeat verbatim in every prompt):

> "Male human ranger, gaunt face with sunken cheeks, broken nose that leans to the left, stubble beard, greasy shoulder-length black hair, distinct vertical scar running through the right lip."

### 5.2 The Five-Part Character Method

For initial generation, structure as:

1. **Core identity:** Race, class, age, one key personality trait
2. **Physical features:** Face shape, build, distinguishing marks, hair, eyes
3. **Attire and equipment:** Armor type, primary weapon, key accessories
4. **Mood and expression:** Emotional state, body language, attitude
5. **Art style and setting:** Visual direction, background, lighting

**Tested example:**

> "Create a photorealistic portrait of a male half-orc barbarian, middle-aged veteran with graying black hair in a warrior's topknot, weathered face showing both kindness and battle experience, piercing green eyes, intricate tribal tattoos covering muscular arms. Wearing worn leather armor with fur shoulder pauldrons, carrying a massive greataxe with glowing blue runes. Standing confidently in a misty forest at dawn. Shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, shallow depth of field. Dramatic rim lighting from behind, golden hour ambient fill. No cartoon, no anime, no illustration."

### 5.3 Handling Fantasy Races (Biological Plausibility)

The model has "World Knowledge" — it knows what a Tiefling is. But photorealism requires guiding it from "cosplay" looks (face paint) toward **biological plausibility**.

**Tieflings and Horned Humanoids:**

The problem: Horns look glued to the forehead. Skin looks like body paint.

The solution: Describe anatomy of the connection. "Curved ram horns protruding from the frontal bone, pushing back the hairline. Skin transitions into keratin at the base of the horns."

For skin: Use Subsurface Scattering (SSS) prompts — "Crimson skin with natural subsurface scattering, visible veins, and natural skin texture variability."

**Dragonborn and Lizardfolk:**

The problem: Scales look like a flat texture map.

The solution: Macro photography terms — "Individual scales with varying sizes and roughness. Nictitating membranes visible in the eyes. Moist, rough texture on the snout. Specular highlights on the scales."

**Warforged and Constructs:**

The problem: Clean 3D render look.

The solution: Focus on wear and manufacturing — "Brushed steel with visible scratches and oxidation. Oil leaks in the joints. Exposed copper wiring. Dents and pitting on the metal surface."

### 5.4 The "Drift Shield" for Iterative Editing

When moving a character from forest to dungeon, the model often changes the face to match new lighting. The Drift Shield prevents this:

> "Change only what I specify. Keep pose, framing, lighting, and likeness the same."

This acts as a "semantic lock," forcing the model to calculate a mask around the character and preserve pixel data within it.

### 5.5 The Style Bible (Campaign Consistency)

Paste at the start of every session for consistent NPCs:

> "Painterly high fantasy illustration, warm but muted color palette, soft rim lighting, realistic proportions, no anime influence, no chibi style, no modern clothing or objects, no text or watermarks, clothing and armor should look worn and functional, faces should be distinctive and memorable."

---

## 6. Environments: Worldbuilding and Maps

### 6.1 The Architect Approach: Orthographic Battlemaps

Generating usable top-down maps for VTTs requires fighting the model's bias toward perspective shots:

> "Top-down orthographic view of [Location]. 90-degree camera angle, perfectly flat. Battlemap style. High contrast floor textures. No perspective, no vanishing point. 16k resolution, sharp focus. Architectural plan style. No grid."

**Grid best practice:** Prompt "No grid" for a clean image, then apply the grid within the VTT software (Foundry/Roll20). The model's grids warp at edges and rarely align perfectly for tactical use.

### 6.2 Atmospheric Lens Choices

**The Dungeon (Claustrophobia):** Use 16mm or 24mm wide-angle.
> "Claustrophobic wide-angle shot (16mm) of a damp dungeon corridor. The stone walls loom over the viewer. Wet floor reflecting torchlight. Low visibility, heavy shadows."

**The City (Density):** Use 200mm telephoto to compress the crowd.
> "Telephoto shot (200mm) compressing the crowd in a bustling medieval market. Layers of depth—people, stalls, banners, castle walls all visually stacked close together. Heat haze, dust."

### 6.3 Depth Layering

Explicitly specify **foreground, midground, and background**:

> "Foreground: moss-covered fallen stones and wildflowers. Midground: a winding stone path leading to a crumbling gatehouse. Background: mist-shrouded mountains under a twilight sky."

### 6.4 Volumetric Environments

"Empty" air looks fake. Photorealistic air has volume.

**Keywords:** "Volumetric lighting," "god rays," "atmospheric haze," "dust motes," "fog banks," "humidity"

> "A swamp at dawn. Thick volumetric fog hangs low over the water. God rays cut through the cypress trees, illuminating millions of floating dust particles and insects. The air looks heavy and humid."

---

## 7. Items, Artifacts, and UI: The Loot Factory

### 7.1 Grid Generation Protocol (Sprite Sheets)

Instead of generating one at a time, produce a full sheet:

> "A 4x4 grid of medieval potion bottles. Each cell contains a unique bottle with distinct shape and liquid color (red, blue, green, purple, gold). Stylized realism, clean outlines, glass transparency effects, soft top-down lighting, plain white background, consistent item scale. No text, no bleeding between cells."

The transformer separates the canvas into 16 distinct "regions of interest," preventing color bleed between cells — a massive improvement over diffusion models.

### 7.2 Macro Photography for Artifacts

For legendary item hero shots:

> "Macro product photography of an ancient gold ring on a dark velvet background. Extreme close-up. Shallow depth of field (f/2.8). Focus on the intricate elven runes engraved on the surface. Realistic material textures: microscopic scratches, oxidation, dust motes on the metal. Dramatic rim lighting."

### 7.3 OCR-Powered Handouts and Signage

**Wanted poster:**
> "A weathered parchment wanted poster nailed to a wooden post. The text 'WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE' is printed in large, bold, distressed serif font at the top. Below is a charcoal sketch of a goblin. Realistic paper texture, water stains, rusted nail."

**Tavern sign:**
> "A wooden tavern sign swinging in the rain. The text 'THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB' is carved into the wood. Moss growing in the lettering. Realistic wood grain."

**Spell scroll:**
> "'FIREBALL – 3rd Level Evocation' in weathered hand-lettered calligraphy on aged parchment, singed edges, dripped candle wax seal."

### 7.4 VTT Tokens

> "Top-down token art of a [Character]. Circular frame. Transparent background outside the circle. High contrast for visibility at small sizes."

**Note:** The model simulates transparency (checkerboard background) but doesn't always output true transparent PNGs — a "Remove Background" tool is often needed as a second step.

---

## 8. The Arcane Visuals: Magic and VFX

### 8.1 The Physics-First Principle

"High Fantasy" magic looks like neon cartoons. "Photorealistic" magic looks like **energy interacting with matter**.

| Effect | Standard (Bad) | Physics-Based (Good) |
|---|---|---|
| **Energy orb** | "A glowing orb" | "A distortion in the air that refracts the background like a lens" |
| **Fireball** | "A ball of fire" | "Intense thermal radiation, heat haze and shimmering air (mirage effect) around the caster's hand" |
| **Magic missile** | "Glowing darts" | "Casts a harsh, blue light on the corridor walls. Hard, distinct shadows" |

### 8.2 Diegetic Magic Lighting

Force the magic to **be** the light source:

> "A wizard casting a spell in a dark cave. The only light source is the purple magical energy in his hand. It illuminates his face from below (uplighting), casting long, eerie shadows into his eye sockets. The rest of the cave is pitch black."

### 8.3 The VFX Approach

Treat prompts like a VFX artist describing a movie shot:

**Keywords:** "Particle effects," "volumetric lighting," "chromatic aberration," "lens flare," "optical distortion," "subsurface scattering"

**Eldritch Blast example:**
> "A beam of crackling force energy. It looks like a tear in reality—jagged edges, violet and black. Around the beam, the air is shattered like glass. High contrast, cinematic VFX style, photorealistic integration with the environment. Debris floating in zero gravity around the impact point."

---

## 9. The Iterative Workflow

### 9.1 The Conversational Advantage

ChatGPT's biggest advantage over Midjourney and Stable Diffusion: **conversational editing**. The model remembers every image and instruction, enabling refinement like directing a human artist.

**Optimal workflow:**

1. Start with a **short, focused prompt** (20–30 words) capturing the essential vision
2. Evaluate the result
3. Refine through targeted conversational instructions: "Make the armor darker and more battle-worn," "Add volumetric fog," "Shift lighting to cooler blue tones"
4. Use **inpainting** (highlight specific area + describe change) for hands, expressions, or armor details

### 9.2 The Three-Strike Rule

If the model fails after **three revision attempts**, stop and start a completely fresh chat with a more detailed prompt incorporating lessons learned. Continuing beyond three tries produces diminishing returns and model drift.

### 9.3 Chat Hygiene

Previous images **contaminate** subsequent generations — style cues, color palettes, and compositional elements carry over. **Always start a new chat for unrelated images.** Same chat only for iterating on a single image or maintaining series consistency.

### 9.4 The Drift Shield in Practice

**Input:** Image of Ranger in Forest.

**Prompt:** "Change the background to a dark stone dungeon corridor. Change only what I specify. Keep pose, framing, lighting, and likeness the same."

## 10. Meta Prompts and System-Level Tricks

### 10.1 Role-Based Priming

> "Act as a veteran DnD concept artist who creates photorealistic character portraits for official campaign sourcebooks."

or

> "You are a National Geographic photographer specializing in dramatic landscapes."

### 10.2 Use o3 as a Prompt Optimizer

The single most powerful meta-technique. OpenAI's own guide recommends:

> "Ask o3 to write 3 varied prompts optimized for 4o image generation based on your description, with the details filled in."

The reasoning model produces significantly better prompt structures than manual writing. Cherry-pick the best elements from each variant.

### 10.3 The DALL-E Fallback Prevention Hack

Add to ChatGPT personalization settings:

> "Never use the DALL-E tool. Always generate images with the new image gen tool. If the image tool is timed out, tell me instead of generating with DALL-E."

### 10.4 JSON-Structured Prompts

Maximum control for reproducible results:

```json
{
  "scene": "ancient dwarven forge deep underground",
  "subject": "grizzled dwarven blacksmith, mid-50s, braided red beard, leather apron",
  "style": "photorealistic, cinematic",
  "lighting": "fire-lit from the forge below, rim light from molten metal",
  "camera": {"lens": "50mm", "aperture": "f/2.8", "focus": "sharp subject, smoky background"},
  "mood": "intense concentration, heat haze, sparks flying",
  "constraints": "no cartoon, no anime, 2:3 portrait orientation"
}
```

## 11. Safety Filters and Copyright Navigation

### 11.1 Violence Workarounds

DnD is combat — this conflicts with safety filters.

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|---|---|
| "Blood" | "Crimson liquid," "red war paint," "viscous red stains" |
| "Gore," "guts" | "Battle damage," "tattered clothing," "aftermath of battle" |
| Showing the wound | Showing the **reaction** — "A warrior clutching their side, grimacing in pain. Dark stains on the armor. Exhausted posture." |

### 11.2 Copyright Bypass via Biology

You cannot reference copyrighted creature names directly. Describe the creature physically:

- **Beholder:** "A floating spherical creature made of flesh. A large central eye. Ten smaller eyestalks protruding from the top. Large maw with sharp teeth."
- **Mind Flayer:** "A humanoid figure wearing robes. The head resembles an octopus with four tentacles around the mouth. Purple skin."

### 11.3 Artist Style Restrictions

ChatGPT blocks specific living artist names. Describe the style characteristics instead: "oil painting with heavy impasto brushwork and dramatic chiaroscuro" rather than naming a specific artist.

---

## 12. The Ten Most Common Mistakes

1. **Overloading prompts** — focus on 5–7 elements, add detail iteratively
2. **Not specifying art style** — without "photorealistic," the model defaults to generic digital art
3. **Contradictory instructions** — "photorealistic medieval painting" confuses the model. Use "inspired by" or "reminiscent of"
4. **Vague adjectives** — "nice," "cool," "beautiful" provide zero visual instruction. Use "weathered," "battle-scarred," "iridescent"
5. **Repeating words** — "realistic fish in realistic hat with realistic smile" degrades output
6. **Not starting fresh chats** — allows style contamination from previous generations
7. **Accepting "good enough"** — wastes the model's strongest capability (iterative refinement)
8. **Not specifying light sources for dark scenes** — counter the model's darkness tendency with explicit sources: "illuminated by three wall-mounted torches"
9. **Ignoring the yellow tint** — specify "neutral white balance" or "cool color temperature"
10. **Using "artistic" prompts when you want realism** — the Samsung Protocol exists for a reason

---

## 13. Aspect Ratios, Resolution, and Technical Notes

| Ratio | Resolution | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| **1:1** | 1024×1024 | Character tokens, inventory icons |
| **2:3** | 1024×1536 | Character portraits (almost always the right choice) |
| **3:2** | 1536×1024 | Landscapes, battle scenes, environments |

**Cinematic widescreen:** Mention "anamorphic lens" or "2.39:1 aspect ratio" for approximation.

**Transparent backgrounds:** Say "transparent PNG background" for VTT tokens.

**Upscaling pipeline:** Generate in 1.5 → Export → Run through a specialized AI upscaler (Magnific, Topaz) → Import to VTT.

**Composition keywords:** "Rule of thirds," "low angle looking up" (heroic feel), "Dutch angle" (action tension), "bird's eye view" (tactical maps), "extreme close-up" (character tokens).
