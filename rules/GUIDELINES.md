# POV Voice Guidelines for Drusniel Content

## Core Principle

> **Every prequel/lore character knows less than Drusniel at the corresponding point in the main story.**

## Content Tiers

| Tier | Order Range | Purpose | Voice |
|------|------------|---------|-------|
| **Lore** | 101-199 (EN), 1101-1199 (ES) | World texture | Fragmentary, compiled, disputed |
| **Prequel** | 200-299 (EN), 1200-1299 (ES) | Character glimpses | Limited POV, local stakes |
| **Main** | 300+ (EN), 1300+ (ES) | Core narrative | Drusniel's direct experience |

## Lore Rules

### Do
- Present as compiled fragments from multiple sources
- Include marginal notes that argue with the text
- Use contradictory accounts (2-3 versions minimum)
- End with missing pages, burned sections, unresolved questions
- Frame knowledge as institutional belief, not truth

### Don't
- Explain cosmic mechanics definitively
- Provide clean origins for mysterious elements
- Use confident, informed narration
- Treat prophecies or metaphysics as verifiable

### Example Techniques
```
❌ "Wyrmreach was designed to contain..."
✅ "Some claim it was built. Others say it grew. Vorogarth stopped asking which was true."

❌ "The Theocracy moves toward inevitable dominance."
✅ "Syrael copied the figures carefully. The numbers pleased the Council. That was enough."
```

---

## Prequel Rules

### Do
- Keep stakes local and physical (grain, borders, patrols)
- Show characters wrong in interesting ways
- Anchor to tangible artifacts: reports, sermons, supply lists
- End with unverified sightings, filing errors, ignored warnings

### Don't
- Grant characters strategic foresight
- Use "this will matter" framing
- Reveal truths the main story depends on delaying
- Show successful preparation for real threats

### Example Techniques
```
❌ "Lumeshire stands ready."
✅ "Lumeshire believed it had time."

❌ "Chaos gnawed at the world."
✅ "Stone cracked where it never had before."
```

## POV Voice by Author Type

| Author | Voice Style | Blind Spots |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Bureaucrat/Scribe | Files reports, copies figures | Sees doctrine, not reality |
| Border Guard | Watches treelines | Only sees local threats |
| Engineer/Foreman | Structural assessments | Frames everything as mechanical |
| Sage/Compiler | Collects fragments | Cannot resolve contradictions |

---

## Ending Rules

Every lore/prequel must end with one of:
- An unanswered question
- A disappeared person
- An unverified report
- A "problem solved" that isn't
- A missing/burned page
- A warning filed too low to matter

**If the ending feels confident, revise.**

## Pre-Publication Checklist

Before publishing any lore or prequel, verify:

- [ ] Does this character know less than Drusniel at this point?
- [ ] Could this belief be wrong?
- [ ] Does the piece end with uncertainty or error?
- [ ] Are cosmic elements fragmentary, not explanatory?
- [ ] Are threats localized, not structural?

If any answer is "no", revise before publication.
