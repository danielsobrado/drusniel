The Final Principle

Every banned element shares one root cause: substituting form for content, decoration for precision, or familiar rhythm for earned meaning.

The corrective is always the same: Be specific. Be embodied. Show consequence.

If a line exists to sound literary, cut it. If a gesture is generic, make it individual. If a metaphor doesn't clarify, delete it. If nothing changes, the scene isn't done.

This document is a personal style guide. Use what applies. Ignore what doesn't. The goal is clarity about your own preferences—not compliance with mine.
