| Attribute | Detail |

|-----------|--------|

| \*\*Name\*\* | Vel'kara, City of the Obsidian Throne |

| \*\*Region\*\* | Umbra'kor (Drow Dominion) |

| \*\*Population\*\* | ~80,000 |

\## The Great Cavern



\*\*Structure:\*\* An enormous natural cavern expanded over millennia. The ceiling rises 800 feet at its peak, lost in darkness. The city is built vertically into the cavern walls in concentric tiers, with the most powerful at the top (closest to the surface, symbolically closer to the world they once guarded).



\*\*Central Feature:\*\* A massive stalactite formation descends from the ceiling - the \*\*Fang of Venemora\*\* - hollowed and converted into the Temple complex. Purple flames burn eternally at its tip, casting light across the entire cavern.



\*\*Floor:\*\* The cavern floor holds the Sunless Lake (black water, bioluminescent fish), fungi farms, and the slave quarters. To fall is to descend in every sense.

\## Map Generation Prompt



```

Fantasy illustrated underground city map of Vel'kara, a drow dark elf capital carved into a massive underground cavern. Cross-section view showing vertical tiers carved into the cavern walls, descending from top to bottom.



Central dominant feature: an enormous stalactite called the Fang of Venemora, descending from the cavern ceiling, hollowed into a temple complex. Purple flames burn eternally at its tip, casting violet light across the entire cavern. Spider-web patterns in the architecture.



Eight concentric tiers carved into the cavern walls: 

\- Tier 1 (top): Temple complex in the stalactite, council chambers

\- Tier 2: Noble house compounds with fortress-mansions, private bridges between them

\- Tier 3: Military zone with arena, training grounds

\- Tier 4: Mage academy, libraries, workshops

\- Tier 5: Black markets, auction platforms, merchant halls

\- Tier 6: Forges, craft workshops, weaving halls

\- Tier 7: Worker housing, common areas

\- Tier 8 (floor): Black lake called the Sunless Lake, fungi farms, slave quarters



Giant spider silk bridges span between tiers and across the cavern. Carved switchback stairs wind along the walls. The cavern ceiling is lost in darkness 800 feet up.



Color palette: Deep purples, blacks, dark blues for the cavern. Bioluminescent blue-purple glow from fungi patches. Violet light from temple flames and noble crystals. Silver and obsidian accents on architecture. The lake is mirror-black reflecting the purple lights above.



Architectural style: Elegant but menacing, flowing curves mixed with sharp angles, spider motifs everywhere (web patterns, spider sculptures, eight-pointed designs), obsidian and dark stone construction.



Border decorated with spider web patterns and stylized spider designs. Compass rose unnecessary (underground). Scale in "shadow-spans." Elegant flowing script for labels in a style suggesting elvish origins corrupted by darkness.



Lighting creates dramatic shadows - pools of purple-blue light with deep darkness between. Some areas intentionally unlit.



Style: detailed fantasy cartography showing cross-section/cutaway view, dark parchment background with silver/purple ink effect, intricate detail rewarding close inspection.
