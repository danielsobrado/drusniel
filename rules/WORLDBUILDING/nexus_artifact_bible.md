# The Nexus Artifact Bible

**Canon Version — LOCKED**

This document defines the Nexus system as immutable canon.
All story content must comply with these rules.

---

## 1. Core Concept

The Nexus is not a magical relic.
It is an ancient magical governance machine that operates on magic at a system level.

It does not cast spells.
It controls how magic is allowed to exist, move, persist, or be erased.

The Nexus predates modern magical disciplines and was not created by any current faction.

---

## 2. Structural Hierarchy (CRITICAL)

The Nexus system is divided into three strict tiers.
Lower tiers can never replace or override higher tiers.

### Tier I — The Nexus Chassis (The Cube)

- A solid, heavy, geometrically perfect cube
- Non-dwarven design
- Appears inert but constantly emits subtle physical reactions
- Houses admin phases and elemental sockets
- **The chassis alone is incomplete and unstable.**

### Tier II — Admin Phases (BIG, UNIQUE)

Admin phases define what kind of operation the Nexus performs.
They are singular, irreplaceable, and story-defining.
There are five, but only four are normally accessible.

| Phase | Function | Canon Name |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Phase I | Read / Locate | Sense (Beacon Mode) |
| Phase II | Remove | Erase (Null) |
| Phase III | Modify | Alter (Key) |
| Phase IV | Stabilize | Bind (Seal) |
| Phase V | Rewrite Reality | Rewrite (Crown) |

**Phase V (Crown) is forbidden and cannot be slotted normally.**

### Tier III — Elemental Stones (SMALL, MODULAR)

Elemental stones are modifiers, not power sources.

They:
- Shape how an admin phase manifests
- Provide tactical advantages
- Increase stability
- Increase cost and exposure

**They cannot act alone.**

#### Core Elements (Canon)

| Element | Color | Domain |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Water | Blue | Flow, endurance, continuity |
| Air | White | Reach, speed, spread |
| Fire | Red | Intensity, volatility |
| Earth | Green/Brown | Stability, resistance |

Elemental stones:
- Are non-sentient
- Do not resonate independently
- Do not choose bearers

## 3. The Four Active Admin Phases (The Cube Faces)

Each cube face represents a phase of magical operation.

### Phase I — Sense (Beacon Mode)

**Function:**
- Reads magical gradients
- Locates missing components
- Detects fragments, damage, and aligned threats

**Default State:**
When the Nexus is incomplete, Sense mode:
- Is always active
- Cannot be disabled
- Broadcasts its own position unintentionally

This is what characters refer to as "the Beacon".

**Key Rule:**
The Beacon is a mode, not a standalone artifact (initially).

**Costs:**
- Broadcast attracts all Nexus-attuned entities
- Cannot be hidden or masked
- More clarity = stronger signal

### Phase II — Erase (The Null)

**Function:**
- Removes magical presence
- Deletes magical identity/signature

**Writing Rule — LOCKED:**
The Null never blocks.
It removes something that should be there.

**Effects:**
- Creates magical absence
- Causes disorientation and near-death sensations
- Can only be used by compatible bearers

**Requires Elemental Support:**
- Without elements: lethal
- With Water/Air: survivable but costly

### Phase III — Alter (The Key)

**Function:**
- Modifies magical routing
- Rewrites access permissions
- Opens, weakens, or redirects structures

**Limitations:**
- Cannot be used safely alone
- Causes rejection or burning without stabilization

**Requires:**
- At least one elemental stone
- Preferably Erase or Bind nearby

### Phase IV — Bind (The Seal)

**Function:**
- Stabilizes changes
- Makes altered states persist
- Repairs damaged structures

**Cost Rule — ABSOLUTE:**
Every Bind action requires sacrifice:
- Life
- Land
- Lineage
- Permanent loss

**Cannot:**
- Create new structures
- Rewrite fundamental laws

### Phase V — Rewrite (The Crown)

**Status:** Forbidden. Not slotted into the cube.

**Function:**
- Permanent rewrite of magical law
- Alters realm boundaries

**Cost:**
- Wielder is consumed
- Becomes part of the system

**Activation Rule:**
- Requires at least two other admin phases active
- One-time use

## 4. Elemental Stones — Detailed Rules

### What Elemental Stones DO
- Shape manifestation
- Reduce catastrophic backlash
- Provide tactical advantages

### What They DO NOT Do
- Act independently
- Trigger resonance
- Solve plot problems alone
- Override admin logic

### Elemental Modifiers (Expected Outcomes)

| Element | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Water | Smooths, prolongs, stabilizes |
| Air | Speeds, extends, disperses |
| Fire | Intensifies, destabilizes |
| Earth | Anchors, hardens, resists |

**Rule:**
Admin defines what happens.
Element defines how it happens.

### Stacking Rule

- 1 stone = advantage
- 2 stones = risk
- 3+ stones = catastrophic exposure

More stones:
- Louder broadcast
- Faster hunter convergence
- Physical toll increases

---

## 5. Canon Discovery Order (Book 1)

### What the Dwarves Find
- Only the Nexus Chassis
- Sense mode active by default
- No admin plates identified
- No elements present

The artifact:
- Points
- Warms
- Draws pursuit
- Searches for missing components

### Frostgard Ice Cave Discovery

**Element Found:** Water Elemental Stone

**Narrative Effects:**
- Sense mode stabilizes
- Direction becomes precise
- Signal grows stronger, not quieter

**Costs:**
- Environmental cold intensifies
- Maris collapses faster near it
- Ice forms unnaturally

---

## 6. War Usage (Later Books)

Elemental stones give expected but powerful edges.

**Examples:**
- **Bind + Earth:** Unbreakable fortifications
- **Alter + Air:** Rapid troop movement
- **Sense + Fire:** Battlefield awareness (at extreme exposure)

Commanders fight over stones, not the cube.

---

## 7. Resonance Rules (LOCKED)

- Only admin phases resonate
- Resonance triggers when a phase is claimed with purpose
- Elemental stones never resonate alone
- Incomplete Nexus leaks signal

---

## 8. Maris Hale Interaction Rules

- Nexus proximity worsens collapse
- Elemental stacking increases severity
- Sense + Water accelerates shutdown
- She receives truth only, never solutions

---

## 9. Narrative Design Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- No deus ex uses
- No surprise powers
- No sentient elements
- No element-only solutions
- Every gain increases exposure

---

## 10. Core Theme Reinforcement

The Nexus is:
- Useful
- Dangerous
- Logical
- Unforgiving

Understanding increases power.
Power accelerates failure.

---

## Canon Lock Statement

**This Nexus Artifact Bible supersedes all previous interpretations.**

Any future additions must:
- Respect the tier hierarchy
- Preserve causality
- Increase cost proportionally to power
