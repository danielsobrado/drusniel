\## Map Generation Prompt



```

Fantasy illustrated city map of Aelindril, high elf capital in an ancient forest. Bird's eye view showing an organic city grown around seven colossal sentinel trees, each over 500 feet tall, connected by living bridges of silver-white wood.



The city spirals outward from the central tree (Aeltharis) where the Starlight Throne sits on a platform high in the silver-barked canopy. Platforms and structures are grown from the living wood, not built on it - the city IS the forest.



Seven Great Trees dominate the view:

\- Center: Aeltharis (silver bark, glowing leaves) - royal court

\- Northwest: Silvaneth - great library built into trunk

\- North: Lothrien (white blossoms) - temple

\- Northeast: Galadrim (tallest) - ranger watch

\- West: Celeborn (silver-veined) - artisans

\- South: Mellyrn (golden leaves) - bardic amphitheater

\- Southeast: Nimrodel - sacred springs



Ground level shows: Crystal River flowing through center, River Market at confluence, spiral paths connecting all areas. The city fades into ancient forest at its edges - no walls visible.



Multiple vertical levels connected by spiral staircases within tree trunks and vine-wrapped walkways. Living bridges span between the great trees at various heights.



Color palette: Emerald and forest green for leaves, silver-white for elven structures and bridges, golden sunlight filtering through canopy, sapphire blue for water features, touches of gold especially around Mellyrn.



Architectural style: Organic Art Nouveau, flowing curves, no harsh angles, structures grown not built, leaves and branches as decoration, natural forms.



The forest extends endlessly beyond the city - trees grow thicker and more ancient toward the edges. A light mist marks the boundary where The Veil begins.



Border decorated with intertwined leaves, flowing water patterns, and subtle star motifs. Compass rose designed as a blooming flower. Scale in "elder paces." Elegant flowing Elvish-style script for labels.



Lighting suggests eternal golden hour - sunlight filtering through leaves creating dappled patterns. Some areas glow with their own silver light.



Style: detailed fantasy cartography, art nouveau influences, hand-illustrated feel, cream/aged paper background with silver and gold ink accents, intricate organic detail rewarding close inspection.
