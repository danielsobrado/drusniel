\## Map Generation Prompt



```

Fantasy illustrated city map of Solaria, capital of a divine human empire. Bird's eye view showing seven hills rising from a river, with the highest central hill crowned by a massive white marble palace with seven towers of different heights, each topped with gold. 



The city is built in concentric rings: the Crown district at the center-top on the highest hill with palace and massive golden-domed cathedral; Temple district to the northwest with Gothic spires; Noble Quarter to the northeast with tournament grounds visible; Guild Quarter to the west with organized streets; Commons to the east along the river; Docks at the river's edge with wharves and warehouses.



The Aurelian River runs along the eastern edge, 300 feet wide, with multiple stone bridges including one ancient bridge covered in small shops. Ships and barges crowd the water.



Two concentric walls visible: outer First Wall (30 feet, twelve gates) and inner Crown Wall protecting the palace district. 



Color palette: warm golds and cream for Crown and Temple districts, rich browns and forest greens for Noble Quarter, working browns and greys for Guild and Commons, blue-grey for river and docks. Buildings show imperial classical style (columns, domes, symmetry) near crown, Gothic religious architecture (spires, rose windows) in Temple district, elegant manor houses in Noble Quarter, practical timber-frame in common areas.



Beyond the walls: farmland, scattered buildings, a leper colony marked.



Decorative border featuring imperial eagles and laurel wreaths. Compass rose with sunburst design pointing north. Scale in "royal paces." Elegant serif lettering for labels. Noble house sigils as small icons marking their locations.



Lighting suggests golden afternoon, with divine radiance seeming to emanate from the Crown district. Slight haze over the docks. 



Style: detailed fantasy cartography like classic RPG city maps, hand-illustrated feel, parchment background, rich detail rewarding close inspection.
