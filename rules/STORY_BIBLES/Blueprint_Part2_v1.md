# CANON ENFORCEMENT REMINDERS (PART 2)

Before writing ANY chapter in this document, verify:

- **The Voice**
  - Intervenes ONLY at biological or existential limits
  - Never explains itself
  - Never offers comfort
  - Never frames debt as kindness
- **Debt**
  - Always incurred by Drusniel’s choice
  - Never framed as a bargain
  - Cost is cumulative and invasive
- **Magic**
  - Never resolves problems cleanly
  - Always increases exposure
  - Always has visible physiological cost
- **The Nexus**
  - Non-sentient
  - Reads, points, escalates
  - Does NOT guide, punish, desire, or react emotionally
- **Wyrmreach**
  - Is not a destination
  - Is a pressure environment
  - Survival is temporary, never safe
- **Barrier Outcome**
  - Remains ambiguous
- **Dragon Language**
  - Forbidden (no wings, scales, flight metaphors, etc.)

---

# PROSE EXECUTION LOCKS (PART 2)

## ⚠️ LOCK 1: DEBT IS NEVER FRAMED AS FAIR

**FORBIDDEN**:
- “In exchange”
- “A price worth paying”
- “A deal”
- “A bargain”

**ALLOWED**:
- “Say yes or die”
- “This is the only way”
- “It will not save you again”

Debt is coercive survival, not consent.

---

## ⚠️ LOCK 2: MAGIC CREATES VISIBILITY

Any time magic is used:
- Someone notices
- Something tracks
- A later threat escalates

If magic feels helpful without consequence, revise.

---

## ⚠️ LOCK 3: COMPANIONS ARE LIABILITIES FIRST

Elion and Srietz must:
- Cost Drusniel something immediately
- Create future obligations
- Introduce new risks

If a companion feels “useful,” rebalance toward danger.

---

## ⚠️ LOCK 4: THE VOICE ESCALATES, NEVER WARMS

Ch 8: Calm, inevitable  
Ch 12: Familiar, expectant  
Later debts: Impatient, possessive  

If the Voice ever sounds kind, the Debt Engine is broken.
