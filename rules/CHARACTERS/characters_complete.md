## CANON ENFORCEMENT RULES

Before writing any character, verify these constraints:

- **Chassis (Cube)**: incomplete → Sense always active → broadcasts unintentionally
- **Erase (Null)**: removes magical presence/signature; does NOT "block"
- **Elemental stones**: modifiers discovered through consequences; no early system lectures
- **Nyxara**: no "inhuman presence," no visual foreshadowing — political menace only until reveal
- **Barrier outcome**: not obvious until it happens; keep language ambiguous until the event
- **Dragon lords (Vorthrak/Sytherix)**: their dragon nature must not be "public fact" — use "lords" language on-page

# WYRMREACH STORYLINE

---

## Drusniel (Protagonist)

### Physical Description
Male drow (dark elf), early twenties by human equivalent. Obsidian-dark skin with grey undertones, white hair to shoulder length, violet-red eyes that glow faintly in darkness. Lean, athletic build from assassin training—not heavily muscled but coiled with lethal efficiency. Average drow height (5'10"). Long, precise fingers trained to kill silently. When using magic, faint blue-white energy flickers around his fingertips.

### Role in Story
**Protagonist** — a failed trial candidate turned unwilling instrument of prophecy. Drives the Wyrmreach storyline through choices that culminate in catastrophe.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** INTJ (The Architect) — Strategic thinker, independent, values competence, frustrated by his own limitations, plans obsessively
- **Enneagram:** Type 3w4 (The Achiever with Individualist wing) — Driven by need to prove himself, deeply afraid of being worthless, desires to be exceptional
- **Clifton Strengths:** Strategic, Learner, Achiever, Self-Assurance, Focus

### Core Motivation
**To prove he is not mediocre.** Power is the answer he keeps reaching for, even when it costs him. His obsessive pursuit of magical power isn't about ruling or conquering; it's about silencing the voice that tells him he's not enough.

### Background (Nexus Alignment)
Born to a mid-ranking drow house in Umbra'kor, Drusniel grew up in his sister Shyntara's shadow. His latent **air/water magical potential** (extremely rare among drow) caught Zaelar's attention. Zaelar secretly suppressed Drusniel's development for years, sabotaged his Duskborn Trials, manipulated him through fake mental messages from Annariel, and orchestrated his family's murder while framing House Vrinn.

Zaelar gives him **Admin Phase II: Erase (The Null)** as a "courier tool" for crossing—Drusniel does not understand it's a phase plate of a larger machine.

**Drusniel believes:**
1. House Vrinn killed his family
2. Annariel is supporting him via mental link
3. The prophecy is Zaelar's invention

**All three are false.**

### Quirk
Compulsively counts things when stressed—steps, heartbeats, enemies. Taps thumb against each finger in sequence when truly rattled. Unaware he does it.

### Dialogue Style
Controlled and precise when calm. Clipped and coldly sarcastic when angry. Goes quieter when truly furious. Uses formal drow speech patterns but drops them with people he trusts. Deflects personal topics with subject changes or dry observations.

### Dialogue Samples

**Relaxed (with Elion, after establishing trust):**
> "You know what I miss about Umbra'kor? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The food was terrible, everyone wanted to kill each other, and the fashion sense was exclusively 'funeral chic.' But at least the cave walls didn't bleed."

**Stressful (during Coatly pursuit):**
> "Running won't help. Stop. STOP. We need to think. Three exits, two blocked by sound. The cave system branches northwest. Srietz—how far can your smoke spread?"

**Thoughtful (reading ancient cave writings):**
> "Annariel would love this. He always said the old texts held secrets we'd forgotten. Speed beyond natural limits... jumps beyond possibility... Someone survived here before us. Someone figured out the rules."

**Exciting (deflecting an arrow with air magic):**
> "Did you see that? I actually—I caught it. Well. Redirected it. Same thing. Mostly." *pause* "That was the first time it worked when I needed it to."

**Angry (learning the truth about Zaelar):**
> "He is my *what*?" *silence* "Say it again. I want to make sure I understand exactly how thoroughly I've been used."

---

## Shyntara (Deuteragonist)

### Physical Description
Female drow, late twenties by human equivalent. Tall (5'11"), efficient killer's build. White hair in practical braids/knots. Obsidian skin, glacier-pale eyes that evaluate everything for threat potential. Predatory grace. Dark leather armor worn soft from use. Twin short swords at her hips.

### Role in Story
**Investigator / Bridge** — survivor of the massacre; becomes a pirate in Contian and uncovers Zaelar's plot with Annariel. Her evidence reaches Drusniel too late.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ISTJ (The Logistician) — Duty-bound, practical, values tradition and family, thorough, skeptical of change
- **Enneagram:** Type 6w5 (The Loyalist with Investigator wing) — Security-oriented, protective, suspicious of outsiders, prepared for worst-case scenarios
- **Clifton Strengths:** Responsibility, Deliberative, Relator, Consistency, Discipline

### Core Motivation
**To get her brother back alive—even from himself.** She doesn't want to save the world; she wants to save Drusniel. The world is secondary.

### Background
The eldest child and the successful one. Mastered everything their house expected. Disapproved of Drusniel's friendship with Annariel but couldn't bring herself to report it. When the murder happened, she wasn't home. Faced a choice: stay and die in the political fallout, or flee and survive to learn the truth. She chose survival. In Contian, she fell in with pirates.

### Quirk
Sharpens her blades when thinking through problems. The sound of whetstone on steel helps her focus.

### Dialogue Style
Economical, direct, cuts to the point. Uses silence as a weapon. When emotional, becomes more controlled rather than less. Insults are precise and devastating.

### Dialogue Samples

**Relaxed (rare, with trusted allies):**
> "Pirates have one advantage over drow politics: they'll stab you from the front. It's refreshing, really. I always know where I stand. Usually on someone."

**Stressful (under attack):**
> "Two left. High ground, north ridge. Balin—STAY DOWN. Annariel, can you do anything useful or should I assume this is a solo engagement?"

**Thoughtful (examining evidence):**
> "The seal's wrong. House Vrinn uses crimson wax, not burgundy. And this handwriting—it's practiced, not natural. Someone copied my mother's style without understanding how she actually wrote."

**Angry (confronting betrayal):**
> "You had years. YEARS. Every chance to speak. And you chose silence because it was easier. My family is dead. My brother is lost. And you want me to understand your reasons?"

## Zaelar (Main Antagonist)

### Physical Description
Male drow, appears middle-aged (actually centuries old). Gaunt, skeletal elegance. Long white hair with occasional bone-charms. Eyes shift violet to pale silver. Tall, thin, deliberate. Wears dark robes. Tower life leaves him subtly paler than other drow.

### Role in Story
**Main Antagonist / Puppet Master** — sabotages Drusniel's trial, forges the fake mental link, orchestrates the massacre, and launches Drusniel into Wyrmreach carrying **Erase (The Null)** as a phase plate.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** INTJ (The Architect) — Long-term strategist, emotionally distant, views people as variables
- **Enneagram:** Type 5w6 (The Investigator with Loyalist wing) — Hoards knowledge, paranoid about losing control, seeks power through understanding
- **Clifton Strengths:** Strategic, Futuristic, Analytical, Self-Assurance, Intellection

### Core Motivation (Updated)
**Transcendence through system control.** He seeks to exploit the Nexus governance machine, not merely "collect a relic." Everything serves a centuries-long plan to achieve immortality and power beyond mortal limits.

### Background
Exiled from Umbra'kor centuries ago for practicing magic outside Venemora's blessing. Survived on the surface, studied forbidden techniques, accumulated power patiently. Discovered the Nexus system and realized its potential. Has been positioning pieces for decades—Drusniel is merely the latest tool.

### Quirk
Collects hourglasses; measures time compulsively. His tower contains hundreds. He can tell you exactly how much time has passed since any significant event.

### Dialogue Style
Measured, almost gentle. Uses teaching metaphors even when threatening. Rarely raises voice—goes softer when dangerous. Occasionally shows genuine enthusiasm for magical theory before remembering to be menacing.

### Dialogue Samples

**Teaching (explaining air magic to Drusniel):**
> "The old texts describe air magic as 'breath of intention.' Feel the current. Don't command it—suggest. Power gained through force is power that will eventually resist you. Power gained through understanding..." *slight smile* "...that power becomes an extension of yourself."

**Threatening:**
> "I have planned for contingencies you cannot imagine. Your intervention changes nothing except the timeline and, I confess, my opinion of your intelligence. Step aside, or discover exactly how much power 'forbidden' magic accumulates over centuries."

**Manipulation (as "Annariel"):**
> "The mages won't let me contact you directly. I had to find another way. Are you safe? I've heard things... about a teacher on the surface. Someone who understands what we've been trying to do. Maybe he could help you, since I can't."

**Revealed:**
> "Family? We share blood, nephew. That's biology, not obligation. Your mother made her choices when she pretended I never existed. Your father was simply in the way. And you..." *tilt of head* "You were the only drow alive with the potential to cross the nightmare seas. I needed a courier. You should be grateful—I gave you purpose."

---

## Annariel (Supporting)

### Physical Description
Male drow, early twenties. Scholar's build. Obsidian skin with faint deep-blue cast (House Vrinn trait). White hair slightly disheveled. Violet eyes, expressive face. Mage robes slightly askew.

### Role in Story
**Truth-seeker / Guilt bearer** — understands the mental link compromise too late and seeks penance by helping expose Zaelar.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** INFP (The Mediator) — Idealistic, values authentic connections, deeply loyal to personal relationships over institutions
- **Enneagram:** Type 9w1 (The Peacemaker with Reformer wing) — Conflict-averse, wants harmony, but has strong internal moral compass
- **Clifton Strengths:** Intellection, Input, Connectedness, Empathy, Adaptability

### Core Motivation
**To be worthy of the friendship he failed.** His guilt is specific: he knew something was wrong with their mental connection but chose silence.

### Quirk
Annotates everything. Books, letters, walls. Writes in margins, argues with himself in written form. Cross-references, questions, small drawings.

### Dialogue Style
Thoughtful and meandering, often starting sentences in one direction and ending somewhere else. Uses qualifiers ("perhaps," "I think"). Speaks faster when excited. Goes quiet when guilty.

### Dialogue Samples

**Relaxed (studying with Drusniel, before trials):**
> "Look at this passage—it describes mental connection as 'threads of shared experience.' We've been trying to force it, but what if it's already there?"

**Stressful (explaining himself to Shyntara):**
> "I knew. That's what you need to understand—I *knew* something was wrong. The messages didn't feel like him. Too certain. Too... guided. But if I said something, I'd have had to explain how I knew."

**Guilty (quietly):**
> "He's my best friend. My only real friend. And I watched someone else speak through our connection, and I said nothing because I was afraid. How do I make that right?"

## Elion (Major Supporting)

### Physical Description
**Humanoid form:** lean, angular, grey skin like weathered stone, longer-than-elf ears. Amber-orange eyes. Quick, predatory movements. Red markings/paint across face. Ill-fitting scavenged clothes.

**Post-transformation:** hollowed, trembling, barely standing.

### Role in Story
**Major Supporting Character / Mystery** — loyal ally to Drusniel. Vessel for **Sage** (unknown to him), who occasionally feeds him information.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ESTP (The Entrepreneur) — Lives in the moment, adaptive, distrustful of plans, relies on instinct
- **Enneagram:** Type 8w7 (The Challenger with Enthusiast wing) — Refuses vulnerability, protects fiercely, masks fear with boldness
- **Clifton Strengths:** Adaptability, Activator, Self-Assurance, Restorative, Individualization

### Core Motivation
**To never be caged again.** Freedom at any cost. Loyalty to those who respect his freedom without trying to claim it.

### Background
A shapeshifter enslaved for his abilities. Cage-born, escape-forged. Rescued by Drusniel who simply unlocked his cage and walked away. That single act of casual freedom earned unshakeable loyalty.

### Quirk
Smells things before trusting them. Food, rooms, people. Years of detecting drugged meals and poisoned environments.

### Dialogue Style
Short, concrete, distrustful of abstractions. Asks "and then?" to expose flaws in plans. Loyalty is action, not words.

### Dialogue Samples

**Relaxed:**
> "You want to know what's funny about freedom? You spend years dreaming about it. Then you get it, and you don't know what to do with yourself. Turns out being free is harder than being caged. At least the cage tells you where to stand."

**Protective (about Drusniel):**
> "He unlocked my cage. Didn't ask for anything. Didn't make me promise. Just opened the door and walked away. You want to know why I follow him? That. That's why."

---

## Srietz (Major Supporting)

### Physical Description
Small goblin (~3.5 ft). Greenish-grey skin, huge yellow eyes, clever stained fingers with alchemy burns/calluses. Rags held with straps; crooked nose, sharp grin when it appears.

### Role in Story
**Major Supporting Character / Utility** — alchemist and networker. His loyalty evolves from transaction to genuine bond.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ENTP (The Debater) — Quick-minded, sees angles everywhere, tests boundaries
- **Enneagram:** Type 7w6 (The Enthusiast with Loyalist wing) — Avoids helplessness through cleverness, becomes genuinely loyal once trust is earned
- **Clifton Strengths:** Ideation, Strategic, Input, Adaptability, Relator

### Core Motivation
**To never be powerless again.** Knowledge, contacts, and chemistry are his weapons against a world that treats goblins as disposable.

### Background
Escaped Vexrath's tower after three years of slavery. Knows Wyrmreach's underworld intimately. Treats information as currency and survival as the only victory that matters.

### Quirk
Tests everything chemically. Drops a compound on food, examines the reaction before eating. His "safe" and "not safe" standards are unusual.

### Dialogue Style (Canon: no dragon hints)
Fast, nervous, angle-finding. Avoids naming larger truths he can't prove. When discussing Wyrmreach power structures, speaks in terms of **lords, warbands, and patrons**, not "dragons pretending."

### Dialogue Samples

**Transactional:**
> "Information costs. Good information costs more. Information that keeps you alive?" *sharp grin* "That costs whatever you're willing to pay. But Srietz remembers who pays fair. Srietz remembers who doesn't."

**Loyal (later in arc):**
> "Three years in Vexrath's tower. Three years being 'useful' until I wasn't useful enough. You know what I learned? 'Useful' keeps you alive. 'Trusted' keeps you sane. You trust Srietz. Srietz doesn't forget."

---

## Nyxara (Secondary Antagonist) — DRAGON REVEAL MUST BE SURPRISE

### Physical Description (Human Form — No Hints)
A commanding warlord in dark, practical armor. Tall, poised, disciplined. Beauty exists, but it reads as **status and danger**, not "otherworldly." Her eyes are striking but normal; no unusual pupils, glow, scale metaphors, or "mask slipping."

Her presence is intimidating because:
- People obey her instantly
- She speaks rarely and decisively
- She treats war like logistics

**True form:** Revealed only at the climax — a black dragon of immense size.

### Role in Story
**Secondary Antagonist / Manipulator** — recruits Drusniel and uses his rise for her own objectives. Her authority appears political until the reveal.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ENTJ (The Commander) — Strategic, dominant, expects competence, discards the useless
- **Enneagram:** Type 8w9 (The Challenger with Peacemaker wing) — Controls through presence, not rage; patience masks predator
- **Clifton Strengths:** Command, Strategic, Self-Assurance, Focus, Significance

### Core Motivation
**To escape Wyrmreach and dominate what comes next.** She sees Drusniel as leverage, then as a tool, then as a liability she can still use.

### Quirk
Never eats in front of others. (Hidden reason: dragon appetite incompatible with human portions.)

### Dialogue Style (Updated)
Controlled, confident, minimal. Commands sound like decisions already made. No mystical language.

### Dialogue Samples

**Commanding:**
> "You've survived longer than most who arrive with nothing. That suggests either luck or competence. I don't trust luck. Show me competence."

**Threatening (controlled):**
> "I don't give orders twice. The first time is instruction. The second time is unnecessary. Do you understand why I don't give orders twice?"

# EAST SIDE STORYLINE

---

## Dulint (East Side Protagonist)

### Physical Description
Elderly dwarf. Thick-bodied, powerful despite age. Grey beard in rough braids. Iron-ore eyes, deep lines, cracked nails, thick callused fingers. Reinforced miner's clothing.

### Role in Story (Nexus Alignment)
**East Side Protagonist / Burden Bearer** — carries the **Nexus Chassis (the Cube)** unknowingly. The chassis is incomplete, so **Sense mode is always active** and broadcasts unintentionally. Dulint also carries a seer's warning and hides it too long, causing delays that become fatal.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ISFJ (The Defender) — Protective, traditional, carries duty as personal weight
- **Enneagram:** Type 6w5 (The Loyalist with Investigator wing) — Anxious about threat, prepares obsessively, secrets feel like protection
- **Clifton Strengths:** Responsibility, Deliberative, Relator, Context, Belief

### Core Motivation
**Prevent what he was shown.** He believes secrecy will keep the group safe; it actively harms them.

### Background
Great-grandson of Thrain Ironbeard, who discovered the mines that made their family wealthy. Dulint spent decades as a respected miner and trader. Finding the artifact felt like continuation of family legacy. The seer's warning changed everything.

### Quirk
Rambles in stories to stall, unconsciously buying time away from a feared future.

### Dialogue Style
Wanders through stories, digresses into tangents, uses "now, as I was saying" frequently. Goes quiet when cornered about the truth.

### Dialogue Samples

**Rambling:**
> "Now, the northern pass, that reminds me of the time my grandfather—well, not my grandfather exactly, more my great-uncle twice removed—anyway, he always said the northern routes were treacherous, though not as treacherous as that business with the merchant guild in the Year of the Cracked Anvil, which was—where was I going with this?"

**Stalling (when confronted):**
> "The thing about secrets, nephew, is that they're not lies. A lie is saying something false. A secret is... not saying something true. There's a difference. An important difference. Let me tell you about the time—"

**Breaking (finally):**
> "I saw it. The witch showed me. Stonehold burning. You—" *stops* "I thought if I could just... if we took the safe routes... I thought I could change it. I thought I could protect you."

---

## Balin (Supporting)

### Physical Description
Young dwarf (early twenties human equivalent). Stocky, still filling out. Patchy stubble beard. Bright hazel eyes. Quick movements, newer miner clothes, fresh calluses.

### Role in Story
**Momentum / Pressure** — pushes action and questions. Disrupts Dulint's stalling.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ESTP (The Entrepreneur) — Action-oriented, lives in the moment, practical problem-solver, bored by theory
- **Enneagram:** Type 7w8 (The Enthusiast with Challenger wing) — Avoids boredom, seeks excitement, covers anxiety with activity
- **Clifton Strengths:** Activator, Adaptability, Competition, Woo, Positivity

### Core Motivation
**To have his own legend, not live under legacy.**

### Quirk
Keeps a running count of "firsts"—first time seeing an ocean, first time in a tavern brawl. Announces them aloud in inappropriate situations.

### Dialogue Style
Quick, enthusiastic, interrupts without guilt. Uses humor to handle discomfort. Goes quiet when genuinely scared.

### Dialogue Samples

**Interrupting Dulint:**
> "Uncle. Uncle. UNCLE." *pause* "Were you going anywhere with that story, or should I pack a lunch?"

**Excited:**
> "Wait—that's a ship? An actual sailing ship? I've only seen drawings. It's MASSIVE. How does it not sink?"

**Rare seriousness:**
> "Do you think Thrain was scared? When he stole the map? Maybe being scared and doing it anyway is the story. Not the cleverness."

---

## Captain Aldric (Supporting)

### Physical Description
Middle-aged human soldier. Cropped grey hair, grizzled beard, broken nose, hard grey eyes. Broad and armored, posture military-straight. No insignia—the absence is noticeable.

### Role in Story
**Warrior / Vindication Arc** — recognizes the enemy isn't random. His "I was right" moment arrives, but the reward is meaningless next to the real stakes.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** ESTJ (The Executive) — Order-focused, decisive, values competence, respects hierarchy but expects it to be competent
- **Enneagram:** Type 1w9 (The Reformer with Peacemaker wing) — High standards, angry at injustice, but also tired
- **Clifton Strengths:** Command, Discipline, Responsibility, Achiever, Analytical

### Core Motivation
**To be proven right—and make it matter this time.**

### Background
Rose through Lumeshire's military through competence. Warned superiors about organized Grukmar activity. They dismissed him. His scouts Varian and Elric were captured. Superiors blamed him. Dismissed. His old friend Xandor gave him a choice: drown in bitterness or do something that might matter.

### Quirk
Compulsively checks sightlines and exits when entering any space. Positions himself with back to wall.

### Dialogue Style
Clipped and military. Commands without meaning to, then catches himself. Goes quieter and more precise when emotional.

### Dialogue Samples

**Under attack:**
> "Formation. NOW. Dulint, Balin—center. Sorcerer—twenty feet back, clear casting line. Xandor, left flank. I take front. Move with purpose, not panic."

**Bitter:**
> "Remember when I was young and stupid enough to think merit mattered? Good times. Terrible judgment."

---

## Xandor (Supporting)

### Physical Description
Elderly human with Zuraldi heritage. Weathered olive skin, deep eyes fading to grey. Long beard braided with wooden beads. Druid robes in greens/browns. Staff of living wood.

### Role in Story (Updated)
**Wisdom / Direction** — can read patterns and history, but does NOT fully explain the Nexus early. He identifies the chassis as ancient and dangerous, names the behavior as "reading / sensing," and warns that it draws pursuit.

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** INFJ (The Advocate) — Pattern-seeker, values meaning, guides without controlling
- **Enneagram:** Type 5w4 (The Investigator with Individualist wing) — Wisdom-focused, detached observer, shares knowledge selectively
- **Clifton Strengths:** Connectedness, Input, Strategic, Intellection, Futuristic

### Core Motivation
**Ensure knowledge serves purpose before he's gone.**

### Quirk
Speaks to plants, pauses to "listen," proceeds as if replies are normal.

### Dialogue Style
Patient, circular, arrives at points through story rather than statement. Uses nature metaphors. Waits for questions rather than lecturing.

### Dialogue Samples

**Warning:**
> "This thing—it's reading. Sensing. And when it senses, it calls. Not intentionally. Like a wounded animal's blood in water. Everything hungry turns toward it."

**Wise:**
> "The forest doesn't explain itself to travelers. It simply is. Those who learn its patterns survive. Those who demand answers..." *shrug* "...the forest doesn't care about their frustration."

---

## Maris Hale (Omencraft Seer)

### Physical Description
Human female, mid-twenties. Looks sleep-starved and fragile. Dark hair, often unkempt. Pale skin. Pale grey eyes that sometimes look through people. Practical travel clothes.

### Role in Story (Canon)
**Prophecy Receiver / Cost Engine** — drawn to the chassis' Sense resonance. She receives **truth fragments, never solutions**. Proximity to the chassis and elemental stacking accelerates her **body shutdown** (collapse, shallow breathing, irregular heartbeat, prolonged recovery).

### Personality Profiles
- **Myers-Briggs:** INTP (The Logician) — Analytical even about her own suffering, detached as defense mechanism
- **Enneagram:** Type 5w4 (The Investigator with Individualist wing) — Retreats into analysis, fears being overwhelmed, dark humor masks terror
- **Clifton Strengths:** Analytical, Intellection, Input, Adaptability, Deliberative

### Core Motivation
**To understand what she sees well enough to survive it.**

### Quirk (Updated)
Uses distance language when frightened ("she sees…") and only says "I" when it hits hard.

### Dialogue Style
Dry, restrained, dark humor as defense. Becomes clinical while describing visions.

### Dialogue Samples

**Having a vision (fragmented):**
> "She sees... barriers falling. Light where there shouldn't be light. Wings. So many wings. A voice in the darkness saying 'now' and someone who doesn't want to obey..." *blinks, returns* "Sorry. Where was I?"

**Defensive:**
> "No, I can't 'just look' at the future and tell you what happens. That's not how this works. I see fragments. Moments. Usually the bad ones. And they come whether I want them or not."

**Honest:**
> "I'm drawn to this quest. I don't know by what. I only know that fighting it was making me sick, and following it felt like breathing again."

### Merrik (The Slave Dealer)
Half-human with goblin heritage, operates on Wyrmreach's coast. "Rescues" unconscious Drusniel with feigned kindness while calculating his market value. Treats Drusniel well while waiting for the right buyer—pragmatic cruelty dressed as hospitality.

### Szoravel (Zaelar's Partner)
