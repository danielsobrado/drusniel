# Drusniel — Behavioral Tics & Neurodivergent Traits
**Status: LOCKED — Canon rule for all Drusniel POV scenes**

---

## Purpose

This document defines Drusniel's consistent behavioral patterns, nervous tics, and neurodivergent-coded traits. These must be applied consistently across all language versions and evolve meaningfully across the story arc.

---

## PRIMARY NERVOUS TIC: Stone-Tracing

### Definition (Canonical)

> **Under stress, Drusniel visually tracks physical imperfections—especially veins, cracks, or fractures in stone walls—using them as a grounding mechanism to impose order and retain control. The habit degrades as his sense of control erodes.**

### Psychological Basis
- INTJ control-oriented mindset
- Need to impose structure on chaos
- Grounding through external focus rather than internal counting
- NOT a comfort habit—a **control habit**

### Evolution Across Story (Required)

| Stage | Book Position | Behavior | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Clean Control | Act I | Precise, methodical tracing | "He followed the veins in the obsidian. One long. One fractured. One thin and clean." |
| Fractured Control | Acts II–III | Details blur, repetition | "He tried to follow the stone's fractures. Lost track. Started again." |
| Failure | Act IV (once) | Nothing to trace | "There were no walls close enough. No edges. No lines. His breath hitched before he could stop it." |

### Frequency Rules

- **Early book (Act I):** 2–3 appearances
- **Mid book (Acts II–III):** 1–2 appearances, degraded or rushed
- **Late book (Act IV):** 0 appearances, OR it fails once

**More than this = reader notices the author, not the character.**

### When It MUST Appear

Use when Drusniel is:
- Waiting
- Being judged
- Restrained
- Unable to act yet

Examples:
- Before a trial begins
- Outside a closed door
- Listening to authority figures
- Hiding, watching, calculating

### When It Must NOT Appear

Do NOT use when Drusniel is:
- In combat
- Actively casting
- Already in motion
- Emotion has fully broken containment

### Narrative Payoff

Environments where **there is nothing solid to trace** should unsettle him more than danger itself. This creates character payoff—readers feel the loss without explanation.

---

## SECONDARY TIC: Thumb-Finger Tapping

### Definition

> **When truly rattled (beyond normal stress), Drusniel taps his thumb against each finger in sequence. He is unaware he does it.**

### Usage
- Reserved for **extreme stress only**
- Rarer than wall-tracing
- Others may notice and comment
- He denies or is confused when confronted

---

## NEURODIVERGENT-CODED TRAITS

These traits code Asperger's-like and OCD-like behaviors without explicit diagnosis. They must be consistent across scenes.

### Pattern Recognition / Systemizing

| Trait | Manifestation |
|-------|--------------|
| Cataloging | Mentally categorizes environments, threats, exits |
| Rule-finding | Seeks underlying logic in magic, social situations |
| Discomfort with ambiguity | Needs to understand "why" before accepting |

### Social Processing Differences

| Trait | Manifestation |
|-------|--------------|
| Delayed emotional processing | Reacts to emotional events later, in private |
| Masking | Performs expected social responses; exhausting |
| Misreading cues | Occasionally misses implied meanings |
| Direct communication preference | Frustrated by indirect speech patterns |

### Sensory Sensitivities

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Unexpected touch | Flinch, then forced relaxation |
| Chaotic noise | Difficulty focusing; retreats to counting/tracing |
| Unfamiliar textures | Subtle discomfort (doesn't fidget openly) |

### Order & Control Needs

| Trait | Manifestation |
|-------|--------------|
| Routine preference | Disrupted routines increase stress |
| Information hoarding | Collects knowledge as security |
| Planning obsession | Over-prepares; struggles with improvisation |
| Clean categorization | Bothered when things don't fit neat boxes |

---

## WRITING GUIDELINES

### Do

- Show these traits through action, not narration
- Let other characters notice and react
- Allow traits to create friction and consequences
- Evolve traits under pressure (degradation, failure)

### Don't

- Diagnose explicitly in-world
- Make traits "cute" or purely beneficial
- Use traits inconsistently between scenes
- Forget that these traits have social costs

### Language Examples

**Stone-tracing (clean):**
```
Drusniel followed the veins in the obsidian with his eyes.
One long. One thinner. One fractured.
```

**Stone-tracing (degraded):**
```
He tried to follow the cracks in the wall. Lost one. Found another. Started over.
```

**Stone-tracing (failure):**
```
The chamber was too large. The walls too far. Nothing to trace.
Something in his chest tightened.
```

**Thumb-tapping:**
```
His thumb tapped against his fingers. One, two, three, four.
He didn't notice until Shyntara's eyes dropped to his hand.
```

**Pattern recognition:**
```
Three exits. Two blocked by sound. The smell came from northwest.
His mind sorted the information before he consciously chose to.
```

## REVISION CHECKLIST

Before publishing any Drusniel POV scene, verify:

- [ ] Is the nervous tic appropriate for this story stage?
- [ ] Is the tic used in a waiting/restrained context (not action)?
- [ ] Does this appearance count toward the frequency cap?
- [ ] Are neurodivergent traits consistent with previous scenes?
- [ ] Do the traits create consequences, not just flavor?

## PLACEMENT MAP (LOCKED)

**Rule reminder:** This tic appears only when Drusniel is contained, waiting, or judged. Never during combat. Never during active magic.

### ACT I — CLEAN CONTROL (2–3 appearances)

#### Chapter 1 — The Failed Trial

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **1.1 · The Sacred Chamber** | ✅ REQUIRED | Origin imprint. Reader learns tic before understanding meaning. Annariel noticing establishes intimacy. |
| **1.3 · The Separation** | ⚠️ OPTIONAL | Stress fracture. Use briefly, degraded by emotion: tries to follow stone, loses track once, stops when Annariel is gone. |
| 1.2 | ❌ SKIP | Active trial |
| 1.4 | ❌ SKIP | Movement + overhearing |

#### Chapter 2 — Voices in the Dark

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **2.1 · The Empty Days** | ✅ REQUIRED | Reinforce alone. One sentence, no Annariel observing. Shows tic persists when alone, not performative. |
| 2.2–2.4 | ❌ SKIP | Mental messages + temptation = internal focus, not grounding |

---

### ACT II — FRACTURED CONTROL (1–2 appearances)

#### Chapter 3 — The Dangerous Teacher

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **3.3 · The Tower in Shadow** | ✅ REQUIRED | Environment mismatch. Walls are not obsidian. Stone is irregular, unfamiliar. He struggles more. Foreshadows: surface world ≠ home, coping tools are location-dependent. |
| 3.4–3.5 | ❌ SKIP | Active teaching and deception = wrong context |

#### Chapter 4 — Forbidden Knowledge

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **4.1 · The Old Texts** | ⚠️ OPTIONAL | Only if restrained (Zaelar talks, Drusniel listens without responding). Make it short and imperfect—one clause, not a paragraph. Otherwise skip. |

---

### ACT III — DEGRADATION (1 appearance)

#### Chapter 15 — Soldiers of Shadow

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **15.4 · The Conversation** | ✅ STRATEGIC | Ideological stress. Barrier discussion, Nyxara present. Starts habit, stops halfway because subject is too big. Reinforces dramatic irony: "I would never break the barrier." His mind wants order; the idea resists it. |

#### Chapters 16–20

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| All | ❌ SKIP | Combat, chaos, Voice interventions. No grounding allowed—he is reacting, not controlling. |

---

### ACT IV — FAILURE (1 appearance, then never again)

#### Chapter 25 — The Barrier Falls

| Sub | Status | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **25.2 or 25.3 · The Request / The Refusal** | ✅ REQUIRED PAYOFF | Final payoff. He tries to use the tic. Nothing solid enough—no walls, no stone, no fractures. **The habit fails.** After this: never use it again. Readers feel: control is gone, childhood coping mechanisms are useless, cost is final. |

---

### Quick Reference Table

| Act | Chapter.Sub | Use | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|-----|---------|
| I | 1.1 | ✅ | Introduce tic |
| I | 1.3 | ⚠️ | Stress fracture |
| I | 2.1 | ✅ | Reinforce alone |
| II | 3.3 | ✅ | Environment mismatch |
| II | 4.1 | ⚠️ | Optional restraint |
| III | 15.4 | ✅ | Ideological stress |
| IV | 25.2/25.3 | ✅ (FAIL) | Final payoff |

---

### Hard Rule (Do Not Break)

> **If you ever feel tempted to add it elsewhere, ask: "Is Drusniel being forced to wait?"**
>
> If the answer is no — don't use it.
