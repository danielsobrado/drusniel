Below is a **retrospective consistency audit** for **Zaelar** and **Szoravel**, written as an **internal QA document** you can keep alongside the blueprints.

This is **not prose advice**.
This is a **canon-integrity and manipulation-logic audit**: what must already be true, what must never appear, where readers will misread intent, and how to correct without rewriting scenes.

# ZAELAR / SZORAVEL

## Retrospective Consistency Audit (Pre–Act 3)

**Audit Goal**
Ensure that on reread (post-Ch 22, post-reveal), every Zaelar and Szoravel scene reads as:

* **Inevitable**
* **Coherent**
* **Manipulative but not omniscient**
* **Human, not authored**
* **Cruel without moustache-twirling**

If any item below fails, readers will feel *retcon*, *cheating*, or *villain inflation*.

---

## I. ROLE DIFFERENTIATION (HARD CANON)

### Zaelar = Recruiter / Sculptor

* Emotional manipulator
* Validates identity wounds
* Frames harm as opportunity
* Lies through **reframing**, not false statements
* Wants **Drusniel to say yes**

### Szoravel = Handler / Validator

* Procedural
* Transactional
* Impersonal
* Treats Drusniel as a component in a system
* Wants **Drusniel to function**

**Invariant Rule**
If Zaelar ever sounds procedural, or Szoravel ever sounds reassuring, the spine breaks.

---

## II. ZAELAR — RETROSPECTIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK

### A. What Zaelar MUST have known (before Ch 1)

These must be *true*, but **never stated**:

* Drusniel’s trial date
* His family status (assassin house)
* His psychological profile (INTJ, control through competence)
* His bond with Annariel
* That Erase would sever Venemora’s blessing cleanly
* That Drusniel would **feel** the absence and obsess over it

**Why this works**
On reread, Zaelar’s precision reads as preparation, not clairvoyance.

**Red Flag**
If Zaelar ever expresses *surprise* at Drusniel’s reaction to the trial, it contradicts this.

---

### B. What Zaelar MUST NOT know (even later)

* The **exact wording** of the empathy game
* The private joke texture (not the facts)
* How Drusniel will respond emotionally to Debt #2
* Whether Drusniel will break or harden

Zaelar predicts **behavioral ranges**, not outcomes.

**Reader Failure Mode**
If Zaelar seems to anticipate exact dialogue or emotional beats, he becomes a writer stand-in.

---

### C. Zaelar’s Lies — Audit by Category

| Lie Type        | Example                             | Status             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Omission        | Never explaining Erase              | ✅ Correct          |
| Reframing       | “The trial wasn’t designed for you” | ✅ Correct          |
| Emotional Truth | “You’re rare”                       | ✅ True, weaponized |
| Procedural Lie  | “Szoravel trained me”               | ⚠️ Must stay vague |
| Future Promise  | “You’ll return stronger”            | ❌ Never guaranteed |

**Critical Fix if Needed**
Zaelar must NEVER promise return.
Only imply *possibility*.

---

### D. Zaelar’s ONE Allowed Human Flaw

**Canonical Slip**

* Micro-irritation when questioned about pre-dated material

**Audit Rule**
There must be **exactly one** visible crack before Ch 14.

* Zero = inhuman puppet
* Two = reader suspicion too early

If later drafts add more, remove them.

---

## III. SZORAVEL — RETROSPECTIVE CONSISTENCY CHECK

### A. Szoravel’s Knowledge Boundary

Szoravel MUST:

* Know what Drusniel is
* Know why he was sent
* Know the artifact’s role in the system

Szoravel MUST NOT:

* Know Drusniel’s personal losses in detail
* Care about House Vrinn
* Reference Annariel
* Frame Drusniel as special in emotional terms

**Szoravel’s worldview**:

> “The system does not care how the part feels.”

---

### B. First Meeting Audit (Ch 8–9 onward)

On reread, Szoravel’s first interaction should feel:

* Disappointing
* Cold
* Anti-Zaelar

**Reader Reaction (Desired)**
“Oh. Zaelar sold him something that doesn’t exist.”

If Szoravel feels merely *stern*, that’s a failure.
He must feel **indifferent**.

---

### C. Szoravel’s Language Constraints

**Allowed**

* “You’ll do.”
* “That is sufficient.”
* “Again.”
* “No.”

**Forbidden**

* Encouragement
* Validation
* Sympathy
* “I understand”
* Any explanation of *why* the system exists

If Szoravel explains, he becomes a lore device instead of a handler.

---

## IV. ZAELAR ↔ SZORAVEL RELATIONSHIP (CRITICAL)

### Canon Relationship Model

They are NOT:

* Friends
* Mentor/student
* Co-conspirators in conversation

They ARE:

* Sequential operators in a pipeline
* A handoff, not a partnership

Zaelar prepares the subject.
Szoravel processes the subject.

They do not discuss feelings, doubts, or morality.

---

### The Handoff Lie (Must Hold)

What Drusniel believes:

* Zaelar → mentor
* Szoravel → higher mentor

What is true:

* Zaelar → recruiter
* Szoravel → validator

If Szoravel ever acknowledges Zaelar emotionally (“He speaks highly of you”), the lie collapses.

---

## V. DEBT ENGINE INTERACTION AUDIT

### Zaelar and Debt

* Zaelar never names debt
* Never explains consequences
* Frames survival as empowerment

Zaelar’s manipulation ends **before Debt #1**.

If Zaelar comments on debts later, it retroactively weakens the Voice.

---

### Szoravel and Debt

* Aware debts exist
* Treats them as system state
* Does not warn
* Does not exploit emotionally

Szoravel should treat debt like gravity: present, not discussed.

---

## VI. COMMON FAILURE MODES (AND FIXES)

### ❌ Failure: Zaelar too evil on first read

**Fix**: Remove explicit intent. Keep emotional validation.

### ❌ Failure: Szoravel too explanatory

**Fix**: Cut explanations. Replace with procedure.

### ❌ Failure: Zaelar feels omniscient

**Fix**: Add uncertainty language about outcomes, not process.

### ❌ Failure: Szoravel feels like final villain

**Fix**: Make him boring. Systems are boring.

---

## VII. RETROSPECTIVE READER TEST (USE THIS)

After Ch 22, readers should think:

* “Zaelar never lied outright.”
* “He told the truth in the worst possible way.”
* “Szoravel was never cruel. He just didn’t care.”
* “Drusniel chose every step.”
* “The trap worked because it respected his agency.”

If instead they think:

* “They tricked him with magic”
* “This came out of nowhere”
* “The author needed this to happen”

Then the audit has failed.

---

## VIII. FINAL CANON ASSERTION

Zaelar is not a villain who *forces*.
Szoravel is not a villain who *punishes*.

They are worse.

They create a path where:

* The right choice
* Feels like the only choice
* And costs everything later

That is the spine.
