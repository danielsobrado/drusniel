Wind howls. Snow blankets endless plains. Glaciers cling to jagged peaks. This is **[Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)**. It's a realm as harsh as the people it breeds. Here, winter isn't a season. It's a way of life.

## Land of Ice and Legend

[Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)'s history? It's written in ice and blood. Myths speak of the first [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ians. They weren't born. They were carved from glaciers. Their hearts? Unyielding as the frozen north. Their eyes? They glinted with aurora's cold fire.

These were the **Jotun**. Giants among men. Their legacy endures in every [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ian's veins. It whispers in the howling gales. It echoes in the cracking ice.

> "The weak do not survive in [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) - only the strong, the cunning, and the tenacious."

Survival here isn't guaranteed. It's earned. Daily. The land shapes its people. It forges them in frost and fury. Weakness is a luxury [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) can't afford.

## The Frozen Heart

**Jotunheim** stands defiant against the eternal winter. It's more than a city. It's a fortress. A symbol. Stone and ice rise in soaring towers. Within its walls, great hearths roar. They're not just for warmth. They're a challenge to the cold beyond.

In Jotunheim's halls, history lives. **Skalds** sing of past glories. Of trials overcome. Of battles yet to come. Their songs aren't mere entertainment. They're the lifeblood of [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ian culture.

> "In the halls of Jotunheim, the skalds sing of the glories of [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)'s past and the trials that lie ahead."

Here, **kings** rule. But they're not soft southern monarchs. [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ian rulers lead from the front. In peace, they judge. In war, they fight. Always, they embody the spirit of the north.

## Warriors Born and Bred

For [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ians, **war** isn't an occupation. It's life itself. Children learn to wield **weapons** before they can walk. Survival skills are as crucial as breathing. The result? Warriors unmatched in all the realms.

[Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ian fury is legendary. It's cold as the north wind. Relentless as a glacier's march. In battle, they're a force of nature. Unstoppable. Unbreakable. Unyielding.

But it's not just about strength. Cunning matters. **Strategy** is key. A [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ian warrior is a thinker as much as a fighter. They have to be. In the north, a single mistake can mean death.

## Giants and Other Perils

Yet for all their might, [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)ians face threats beyond imagining. **Giants** roam the frozen wastes. They're colossal. Terrifying. Skin like granite. Strength to shatter mountains. These aren't mere enemies. They're forces of nature.

But giants aren't the only danger. The land itself is a constant foe. **Blizzards** can strike without warning. **Crevasses** hide beneath innocent snow. Every day is a battle against the elements.

> "As the world beyond [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/)'s borders grows ever more chaotic and uncertain, the warriors of the north stand ready to defend their homeland against any threat, whether it be the ravening hordes of the giants or the scheming machinations of the Lumeshirean empire."

And there's more. To the south, **Lumeshire's empire** grows. Its gaze turns northward. [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) stands as a bulwark. Not just for itself, but for the entire north.

[Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) is more than a kingdom. It's a legacy. A birthright. A sacred trust. It's the north's beating heart. Where legends are born. Where heroes are forged. As long as mountains stand and winds howl, [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) will endure. Its spirit? Indomitable as the land itself. This is [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/). Unyielding. Unbroken. Eternal.
