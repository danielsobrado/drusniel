## Prologue | Border Sign

--- 

The captain's quarters smelled of damp timber and stale wax. Maps covered Aldric's desk like scars, overlapping and peeling at the corners. He didn't look up when Varian entered, nor did he acknowledge the stiff salute.

*"Tell me,"* Aldric said, his finger tracing a ridgeline on the parchment.

*"More sign, sir."* Varian's voice came out lower than he intended. *"Fresh. Within a league."*

That got him. Aldric's head came up, eyes flinty beneath grizzled brows. Elric stepped forward with the sketch—charcoal lines on crumpled parchment—and jabbed a finger northeast of their position.

*"Here. Tracks in the loam. Snapped branches."*

Aldric stared at the map. His jaw worked once, twice, like he was chewing something that wouldn't break down. Against the far wall, Tormund and Brynn exchanged a look that Varian pretended not to see.

*"Double the watch."* Aldric's voice cut the silence. *"Every approach patrolled. Tormund, Brynn—pull in the men from the farthest fields."*

The two guards moved for the door without a word. Aldric turned back to Varian and Elric, and something shifted in his face—a loosening, or maybe just exhaustion finally showing through.

*"Walk the northern line. Follow the tracks, but don't range far."* He paused. *"First sign of trouble, you turn back. We're not hunting glory out here."*

*"Yes sir."*

Aldric held Varian's gaze a moment longer. Whatever flickered in those hard eyes was gone before Varian could name it.

---

They walked the old game trails in silence. Mist curled between weathered trunks, swallowing sound. The sun rose behind them—pale, grudging light that did nothing to warm the air.

Varian watched the drifting shrouds, tension building with each step. Hal and Leofric followed close behind, boys with patchy stubble and white-knuckled grips on their spears. Too young for this. But the outpost took whoever the villages could spare.

The stories whispered in Varian's head. Dark legends from late-night fires. Cunning beasts who walked like men. Blood-spattered stones.

Children's tales.

But out here, in this hushed world of mist and shadow, those tales felt like something else entirely.

---

Elric froze. His knuckles went white on his spear-haft.

Varian eased forward, heart thumping beneath his leathers. Elric didn't speak—just pointed with a jerk of his chin toward the loam beneath the fern-line.

The prints were there. Clawed, splayed, and deep. The mud at the edges was still slick, water seeping into the depressions.

[![tracks](https://i.imgur.com/4mHL1Li.png)](https://i.imgur.com/4mHL1Li.png)

Varian crouched and touched one. His fingertips came away damp.

*"An hour,"* Elric whispered. *"Maybe less."*

Behind them, Leofric's breathing had gone ragged. Varian didn't turn around. He kept his eyes on the tracks, on the way they disappeared into the mist like a path inviting him forward.

*"Back,"* he said. *"Now."*

---

Dusk bled across the sky as they walked back. No one spoke. Varian's shirt clung to his back—sweat gone cold.

The outpost hunched ahead, a dark shape against the trees. The guards on the palisade hailed them, voices harsh with something that might have been relief.

[![return](https://i.imgur.com/orP97Dj.jpeg)](https://i.imgur.com/orP97Dj.jpeg)

Aldric waited in the torchlit yard. Varian made the report, tongue heavy with exhaustion. The captain listened, gaze distant, seeing something beyond the words.

*"Get some rest,"* Aldric said. *"I'll want you fresh come morning."*

[![review](https://i.imgur.com/mkbZDwQ.jpeg)](https://i.imgur.com/mkbZDwQ.jpeg)

They trudged toward the cookfires. The smell of stew—barley and salt pork—should have made Varian's stomach growl. It didn't.

*"Scouts,"* Elric said, low enough that only Varian could hear. *"Testing our lines."*

Varian nodded. He glanced back at the darkness beyond the palisade, at the place where torchlight gave way to black.

Nothing moved out there.

That was the part that bothered him most.

--------------------


########## No Tracks ##########

--- 

## Prologue | No Tracks

--- 

Mud pulled at Varian's boots as he climbed toward the outpost. Elric followed a step behind, breathing through his nose like the air itself offended him.

The girl's eyes had lodged behind his own. Not fear in the abstract. Fear with a shape. Fear that stared past him at the treeline as if the trees were a doorway.

*"Sleep?"* Elric asked.

*"No."*

*"Same."*

After that, words felt like noise you made right before something found you.

Alden waited by the captain's door. Both hands on his spear. Not leaning—bracing. His face had lost its color, and that did more to Varian than any alarm bell.

*"Riders,"* Alden said. *"Frontier villages. They're with the captain."*

---

Varian knocked once and went in because waiting felt like a luxury.

Aldric stood behind the desk, hands flat on the wood. Two men in mud-spattered cloaks faced him, shoulders rounded like they'd been carrying something heavy for miles.

*"...three more cattle,"* one was saying. *"Throats opened."*

Aldric looked up. His expression was the one he wore before storms hit the wall.

*"Varian. Elric."* Two names, clean and clipped.

*"They didn't take the meat,"* Elric said, because he was fast enough to see the wrong part.

The rider nodded. *"Left them where they fell."*

The silence landed on Varian's shoulders like a physical weight.

*"Sir."* He forced himself to say it straight. *"Village incident last night. A girl. Clawing at air. No attacker."*

He didn't say how her eyes had fixed on the forest like she'd seen something leaning between the trunks.

*"No tracks,"* Aldric repeated, testing the sentence for weakness.

*"None. But she stared at the trees like they were standing too close."*

Aldric dismissed the riders with a nod that meant: go, before fear spreads. When the door shut, he didn't show the weight. That was the point of him.

*"No one crosses into [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)."*

He said it like a boundary line on a map that existed because men died past it.

*"We watch. We guard. We don't go hunting."*

---

The sun climbed higher—a cold eye behind scudding clouds. Varian paced the village edge until his legs ached. Every shadow looked like it was waiting.

By dusk he found Elric in the armory, running a whetstone along his blade.

*"Quiet?"*

*"So far."* Elric didn't look up. *"Feels wrong. Like a storm you can smell but can't see."*

*"And when they cross first?"*

*"Then we'll be ready."*

---

First watch they took together. The forest lay utterly still. No wind. No birdsong. Nothing but the creak of their boots and the sound of their own breathing.

*"The stories,"* Elric said. *"About goblin rituals. You believe any of it?"*

*"Meant to scare children."*

*"But you don't?"*

For a long moment Varian didn't answer. *"I believe something lives in that forest that doesn't think the way we do. Maybe the goblins serve it. Maybe it uses them. Either way, only a fool goes looking."*

Elric froze. *"There."* His torch jabbed toward the treeline.

Varian squinted. Movement. A flicker, there and gone.

[![forest](https://i.imgur.com/JuTilc0.png)](https://i.imgur.com/JuTilc0.png)

His blade slid free. They stood frozen while the night pressed close.

A branch cracked.

Varian spun. A shape burst from the trees—

A rabbit. A terrified rabbit that scampered between the posts and vanished.

Elric sagged against the wall, laughing shakily. *"Found our goblin."*

Varian didn't smile. When he sheathed his sword, his hands weren't steady.

---

Rest proved elusive. Varian tossed on his narrow bed while shadows crawled across the ceiling. The girl's face swam behind his eyes. The old trees, their branches reaching like fingers.

When sleep dragged him under, it was full of looming shapes and the thick copper stench of blood.

---

Grey dawn. Grey sky.

Elric waited in the yard, face drawn and haggard.

*"Patrol's back. They found tracks."*

Through the gate, toward the treeline. A knot of men stood in tense silence. They parted as Varian approached.

In the damp earth: prints, long and splayed, unmistakably inhuman.

Elric crouched, tracing one with his finger. *"Half a mile along the border."*

Varian stared into the forest—into those dark spaces between the trunks where anything might be watching.

The men dispersed. Varian stayed where he was.

He thought of the farmers who worked their fields within sight of that treeline. Brave fools, or blind ones. He'd never been able to decide.

The wind shifted. For a moment, he could have sworn he smelled something underneath the pine and loam. Something wrong.

Then it was gone.

########## The Scream ##########

--- 

## Prologue | The Scream

--- 

[![watchtower](https://i.imgur.com/ZgytCdQ.jpeg)](https://i.imgur.com/ZgytCdQ.jpeg)

Wind knifed through the watchtower, setting the old timbers creaking. Varian leaned against a rough post and looked down at the village below—huts clustered beneath the forest's shadow, mist coiling through muddy streets.

Behind him, Elric shifted his weight. The boards squeaked underfoot. Firelight caught the lines on his face—marks of too many sleepless nights.

*"Quiet,"* Elric said.

*"Always is."*

*"Could be worse. Heard they're battling giant hordes in the [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) passes."*

Varian snorted. *"Better than guarding turnip farmers from their own shadows."*

*"Who says that's all we're guarding against?"*

The question hung between them. Varian wanted to dismiss it—village gossip, nursery rhymes—but the words wouldn't come. The forest watched them with a patience that made his skin prickle.

---

*"My uncle served in the [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) campaigns."* Elric's voice dropped. *"He told me things. Things they don't want known."*

*"Such as?"*

A glance over the shoulder—quick, nervous, as if the night itself might be listening.

*"The [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)i revere old gods. They use captives for rituals. Blood magic."*

*"Horseshit."* The denial came automatically. But doubt crept in anyway, cold and unwelcome.

*"Then why did the Empire pull back? Why leave all this land empty?"*

Varian poked at the coals. The stories from his childhood surfaced unbidden—blood-soaked offering stones, monsters that walked like men.

Foolishness.

*"This backwater's rotted your brain,"* he growled. *"Nothing out there but—"*

---

A scream split the darkness.

High. Terrible. The kind that reaches into your chest and squeezes.

Both men froze.

*"The square!"*

They moved. Muscle memory took over where courage failed. Boots hammered down rickety steps. Armor clanked too loud in the silent village.

The village lay shuttered and still. Only wisps of chimney smoke proved anyone was alive in there at all.

*"There!"*

A small figure stumbled from between two huts. A girl, twelve at most, dress torn and filthy. She lurched into the open with her arms flailing, fighting at shadows only she could see.

Varian reached her first. He dropped to a crouch, close enough to catch the smell of fear rolling off her—acrid, animal.

*"Are you hurt?"*

Her face lifted. A mask of terror. Tear-tracks cutting through the grime. Her mouth worked but nothing came out. Then her fingers found his arm and dug in, nails biting through fabric, and she was shaking so hard he could feel it in his bones.

*"You're safe."* The words rang false. *"Let's get you home."*

She wouldn't move. Her eyes stayed fixed on the alley mouth, on the shadows pooling between those leaning walls.

Slowly, Varian turned to look.

Nothing.

Just darkness. Just an empty alley.

But the girl made a sound—small, wounded, more animal than human—and it cut through him worse than any shout.

His grip went white-knuckled on the spear. The night pressed close, thick with something he couldn't name.

Later, he would tell himself she'd seen nothing. A trick of shadow. A fever dream.

But her eyes never left that alley. And when he finally turned away, leading her toward the lights of the village, the back of his neck prickled like something was watching him go.

########## Tavern Talk ##########

--- 

## Prologue | Tavern Talk

--- 

The Rusty Axe squatted at the village's edge, its wooden walls weathered by seasons beyond counting. Varian ducked under the low doorway, Elric at his heels. Five other guards already hunched around a table near the hearth.

*"No goblins yet."* Varian shrugged off his cloak. *"Maybe we'll get a quiet night."*

*"Quiet."* Elric snorted. *"And I'm the emperor of [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)."*

The tavern air hung thick with sweat and sour beer. At the far end of the room, an old minstrel coaxed a mournful tune from a battered lute. Varian took a pull of ale and grimaced at its bitter bite.

Across the table, Tormund leaned forward.

*"You lads hear about the goblins in the east? Near [Stonehold](https://www.drusniel.com/forge-and-fire-the-mountain-kingdom-of-stoneholds-stand-against-chaos/)?"*

*"What about them?"*

*"Word is they made some kind of deal. With the orcs."*

*"Goblins can barely find their own arses with both hands."* Brynn, a hulking redhead, snorted into his mug. *"You expect me to believe they're suddenly making deals?"*

*"People been disappearing from villages up there."* Tormund spread his hands. *"Something's riled them up."*

---

*"There's more."*

Elara's voice was soft but carrying. The only woman in their group, she'd proven herself twice over—with blade and bow. She had a strange skill for finding gossip that turned out to be something else.

*"They say the goblins have shamans now. Witches who can call up storms and ruin crops with a word."* She glanced around the table. *"They say they kill captives for their gods. Paint their offering slabs with blood."*

Silence fell heavy as a shroud.

Brynn broke it with a forced laugh. *"Stories. That's all."*

*"Stories got to come from somewhere,"* Tormund muttered.

*"But what about the captain's orders?"* Elric spoke up. *"Double watches. No one past the village edges. He's not doing that over stories."*

Brynn said nothing. The doubt on his face said enough.

---

Varian stared into his mug, watching firelight play on the dark surface.

Old superstitions. No sensible man believed such tales.

Yet.

He thought of the tracks they'd found, fresh in the loam. The claw marks on tree trunks—too high for any natural beast. The eerie silence in the forest, as if the very birds and insects held their breath.

He thought of the girl. Her eyes, fixed on that alley mouth. The way she'd shaken like something had reached inside her and squeezed.

*"Another round,"* he called to the barkeep.

The ale was bitter. But not as bitter as what lingered on his tongue.

The conversation drifted to safer topics. Harvests. Sweethearts left behind. Dreams of glory.

But beneath it all, the current ran dark.

Outside, night pressed close. And in the depths of [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) forest, the trees stood silent, holding their secrets like teeth holding a tongue.
