1. filename: dulint-approaches-cave.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]. Determined and tense; shoulders squared into the climb, breath visible, one gloved hand gripping rock as the weight of a wrapped artifact case pulls at his pack straps. Above the treeline on a steep mountain path, snow crust and exposed stone alternate underfoot, a sheer drop falls away beside the trail, and a dark cave mouth cuts into the slope. Cold mountain daylight filtered through thin cloud flattens the world into blue-grey; wind-driven spindrift catches bright highlights along the path edge and throws fine granular snow particles across the frame, while the cave lip holds a faint pale rim where the weak sun grazes stone. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: seer-waiting.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "She was waiting when he arrived, as if she'd known he was coming.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Seer, Dulint]. Waiting without emotion; the Seer sits near a small fire at the cave threshold with a stillness that reads like certainty, Dulint stands just inside the entrance, hesitant. Damp stone walls with frost melt, soot smears, thin smoke drifting between them, bright snow outside turning the interior claustrophobic. Warm firelight from low center creates amber uplight that catches undersides of cheekbones and fingers and paints moving highlights on wet rock; cold daylight from the entrance backlights the smoke into pale blue scattering and adds a clean rim on shoulders, with interactive reflections shimmering on damp stone. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dulint-hears-failure.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "You will fail. The words hit like a physical blow.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]. Shock landing like impact; eyes wide, jaw tight, breath caught, one hand braced on the cold cave wall to stay upright as the verdict lands. The Seer sits blurred near the fire behind him, ash and dust suspended in air, cave mouth leaking cold light. Firelight from the side adds warm orange highlights along one cheek and knuckles; cold daylight from the entrance gives a thin rim on the profile edge and turns suspended smoke into a faint blue veil, with tiny specular points on moisture and grit. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: seer-warns-slowly.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Slowly. One word. She said it like it contained everything.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Seer]. Prophetic severity without drama; she leans a fraction closer and shapes the single word with a mouth barely moving, eyes fixed past Dulint. Extreme close-up with smoke ribbons crossing frame, fire popping softly out of focus below, the rest of the cave falling to black. The small fire provides warm orange uplight that carves deep shadows and catches the underside of eyelids and wrinkles; faint cold entrance light adds a razor-thin edge highlight on one cheek and eyelash line, with halation blooming around the brightest fire points. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight softness at edges, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: dulint-leaves-burdened.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He left the cave with knowledge he couldn't share and a word he couldn't forget.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]. Burdened descent; head bowed, shoulders heavy as he steps away from the cave, leaving footprints cutting through new snow. Vast cold landscape of ridgelines and distant valleys fading into haze, treeline far below, cave mouth behind as a dark notch in stone. Late-day mountain light sits low behind cloud, casting long muted shadows; windblown snow becomes bright drifting streaks near the ground while distant haze softens contrast and scatters light across the valley. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight barrel distortion, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
