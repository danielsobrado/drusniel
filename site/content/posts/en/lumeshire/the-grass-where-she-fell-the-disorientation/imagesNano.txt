1. filename: maris-on-road.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: exhausted and worn down, posture stubbornly upright as she keeps moving. Wide establishing shot of a dusty road leading toward distant Riverhold as she walks alone and a merchant cart rumbles past, kicking up dry dust that hangs in the air. Late afternoon sun is harsh and hazy, flattening the landscape into warm glare; dust turns into a glowing veil around wheels and boots, interactive highlights flashing in grit. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: reality-check-pain.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The only way to come back was to anchor herself in sensation. Pain worked best.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: dazed eyes unfocused, fingers pressing into cheek and mouth as she anchors herself in pain. Close portrait with the road and field behind rendered with subtle ghosting and slight double exposure, like black-water ripples trying to overlay reality without becoming literal. Bright sun hits hard on one side of her face; the shadow side stays heavy and cool, interactive highlights catching sweat and dust. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: riverhold-gate-check.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The guard grunted and waved her through.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: tight controlled composure, lying with her eyes while hands still tremble. Medium shot over the guard's shoulder as she stands before a bored Riverhold gate guard under the stone arch, answering questions with short words while travelers queue behind. Gate shadow swallows most of the frame cool grey; a strip of late sun cuts across her face and armor plates, interactive highlights catching dust on fabric and stone grit. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: riverhold-streets.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The town was busy but not crowded. Shops lined the main street")
prompt:Photorealistic high angle on Riverhold's main street: shops lining the road with hanging signs swinging in an evening breeze, an inn corner glowing warm, people moving with purpose. Maris is a still point in the moving crowd, looking out of place as ordinary life flows around her. Golden hour warms the street; deep shadows pool under awnings and doorways, interactive highlights sliding across cobbles and sign chains. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-waits-wall.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "So she waited. Leaned against the wall as the sun sank lower.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: hollow patience and stubborn fear, arms wrapped tight as she waits for the pull to become direction. She leans against a rough stone wall in a side street, breathing slowly while market sounds and distant laughter blur away. Setting sun provides a fading warm edge; twilight shadows deepen under her eyes and along wall texture, interactive highlights catching grit in mortar. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
