1. filename: maris-enters-room.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: frazzled and overwhelmed, paused in the doorway, breath shallow, eyes locked on the cube. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: calm guide at her shoulder, already half turned toward the table. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Expression: leaning forward with weathered concern, ready to act. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: guarded suspicion held tight, posture closed. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Expression: eager caution, eyes wide as he watches the Beacon react. Candlelit back room of The Wanderer’s Rest: four figures around a small table fall silent and turn as Maris enters, and the Beacon sits at the center like a weight, dark metal cube with shifting symbols that refuse direct focus. Warm candlelight casts deep shadows across rough wood and stone; the Beacon emits cold blue-white glow that distorts the air slightly and throws sharp cool highlights on knuckles and metal, interactive halation trembling in the haze. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight lens flare from the Beacon glow. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: beacon-screaming.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The word came unbidden. Screaming.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on the Beacon: dark metal cube with shifting geometric symbols that brighten and fade in unreadable patterns, edges scuffed like it has been handled too long; the air around it shows faint heat-haze distortion as if the cube is vibrating a silent scream. Cold blue-white internal glow is the key light, casting hard specular highlights on metal edges; candlelight adds warm amber rim that reveals scratches and dust, interactive reflections sliding on polished corners. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the glow, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dulint-concerned.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "For most of us, it points, Dulint said. Shows direction.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Expression: deep concern and steady leadership, voice implied in careful explanation. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Expression: curiosity edged with trauma, leaning forward despite himself. Portrait of Dulint seated at the table looking at Maris while Balin watches from the near background, their attention returning to the Beacon at center. Candlelight provides warm amber across faces and beard line; the Beacon adds a thin cold rim on cheekbones and knuckles, interactive highlights trembling on metal cups. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: Eldric-suspicious.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "We don't know her. Currently justified, Eldric said.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: sharp suspicion held behind stillness, leaning back with arms crossed, eyes partly shadowed as he measures Maris. Medium shot in the candlelit back room with the table edge and a hint of the Beacon glow reflecting on his forearm. Warm candlelight stays low and leaves his eyes in shadow; cold blue-white Beacon glow adds a hard rim on cheek edge and chair back, interactive contrast sharpening the distrust. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-accepts-burden.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Hold on, she thought at the stranger drowning in black water.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: resolved though fearful, eyes wet with pain, jaw set; hand hovering near the table edge as if pulled forward. Close-up on Maris as she stares at the Beacon just off frame, room behind dissolving into candlelit blur. The Beacon’s cold glow paints soft blue-white across cheek and iris reflections; candlelight adds warm amber along fingers and mouth corner, interactive split of warmth and cold. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation in eye reflections, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
