1. filename: maris-enters-room.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, frazzled and overwhelmed by the screaming in her mind; paused in the doorway, breath shallow, eyes locked on the cube. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Calm guide at her shoulder, already half turned toward the table as if this was inevitable. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Leaning forward with weathered concern, ready to act. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Guarded suspicion held tight, posture closed. [Face_Reference: Balin] Eager caution, eyes wide as he watches the Beacon react. Candlelit back room of The Wandererâ€™s Rest: four figures around a small table fall silent and turn as Maris enters, and the Beaconâ€”a dark metal cube covered in shifting symbols that refuse direct focusâ€”sits at the center like a weight. Warm candlelight casts deep shadows across rough wood and stone, while the Beacon emits cold blue-white internal glow that distorts the air slightly and throws sharp cool highlights on knuckles and metal with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight lens flare from the Beacon glow. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: beacon-screaming.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The word came unbidden. Screaming.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on the Beacon: dark metal cube with shifting geometric symbols that brighten and fade in unreadable patterns, edges scuffed like it has been handled too long; the air around it shows faint heat-haze distortion as if the cube is vibrating a silent scream. The Beaconâ€™s cold blue-white internal glow is the key light, casting hard specular highlights on metal edges, while candlelight adds warm amber rim that reveals surface scratches and dust. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, subtle halation around the glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dulint-concerned.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "For most of us, it points, Dulint said. Shows direction.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, deep concern and steady leadership; eyes heavy, voice implied in careful explanation. [Face_Reference: Balin] Curiosity edged with trauma, leaning forward despite himself. Portrait of Dulint seated at the table looking at Maris while Balin watches from the near background, the Beacon just out of frame but present in the way their attention keeps returning to the center. Candlelight provides warm amber across faces and beard line, while the Beaconâ€™s cold glow adds a thin blue rim on cheekbones and knuckles. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: Eldric-suspicious.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "We don't know her. Currently justified, Eldric said.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, sharp suspicion held behind stillness; leaning back, arms crossed, eyes partly shadowed as he measures Maris. Medium shot in the candlelit back room with the table edge and a hint of the Beaconâ€™s glow reflecting on his forearm, suggesting a threat he doesnâ€™t trust. Candlelight stays warm and low, leaving his eyes in shadow, while the Beaconâ€™s cold blue-white glow adds a hard rim on the edge of his cheek and the chair back. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-accepts-burden.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Hold on, she thought at the stranger drowning in black water.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, resolved though fearful; eyes wet with pain, jaw set as she accepts the burden anyway. Close-up on Maris as she stares at the Beacon just off frame, one hand hovering near the table edge as if the screaming is pulling her forward; the room behind fades away into candlelit blur. The Beaconâ€™s cold glow paints soft blue-white across her cheek and iris reflections, while candlelight adds warm amber along her fingers and the corner of her mouth, creating a tragic split of warmth and cold. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, subtle halation in the eye reflections, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
