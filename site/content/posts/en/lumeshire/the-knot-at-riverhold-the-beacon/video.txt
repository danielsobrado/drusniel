## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The Beacon’s glow intensifies and steadies, a slow pulse that makes the candle flame flare and then shrink; Eldric’s fingers tighten as he fights the instinct to step back.
[00:03-00:05] Papers on the table flutter as if the air pressure shifts, and the cube rotates a fraction, locking its luminous face more precisely toward him.
[00:05-00:08] A second pulse rolls through the room and then fades, leaving a heavy stillness; behind Eldric, a floorboard creaks as someone shifts and then freezes again.

Slow push-in toward Eldric’s eyes as the glow peaks.
Audio: low hum rising and fading, candle crackle, paper rustle, one sharp inhale, distant city muffled through glass, a single creaking floorboard. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
