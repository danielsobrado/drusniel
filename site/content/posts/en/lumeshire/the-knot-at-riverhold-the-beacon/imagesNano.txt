1. filename: Eldric-interrogates.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: controlled intensity, posture dominating the table, fingers splayed on the map. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Expression: drained steadiness, eyes heavy but alert. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Expression: frustration held back, half-risen. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: watchful unease, attention split. In the cramped room above the Scholar’s Rest, they cluster around a cluttered table with a rough Riverhold map, scattered notes, candle stubs, and the Beacon on pale silk, dark metal cut with nonlinguistic geometric channels and a cold blue-white glow that makes the air feel tense. Warm candle flames and wall sconces cast amber across faces and reflect off varnished wood grain; the Beacon’s glow adds icy uplight from below, blue highlights catching undersides of knuckles and jawlines, halation blooming in the smoke-haze while corners fall into pooled shadow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: sense-mode.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "an incomplete artifact in Sense mode is like a beacon that never stops signaling")
prompt:Photorealistic close detail of the Beacon on silk at the table’s center, one face subtly brighter as if oriented; dark metal surface with fine geometric grooves (no letters), edges catching cold blue-white light. The internal glow bleeds into smoky air and lights drifting dust motes, making the room feel like it is quietly broadcasting; nearby candle flames lean and flicker, warm reflections warping faintly along the cube’s corners, amber catching the silk weave while icy highlights trace the metal seams. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: blocked-roads.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The pursuit is already between us and the northern road.")
prompt:Photorealistic exterior night at a Riverhold city gate in rain: slick cobblestones reflecting torchlight, armed silhouettes posted with purposeful spacing, wagon ruts and puddles, wet stone walls and ironwork slick with water. The scene reads as organized pursuit, watchers holding the road without rushing; rain streaks cut through torch glow and vanish into dark. Torchlight and a single gatehouse lantern are the only illumination, warm orange pooling on wet stone and bouncing specular highlights up into the underside of helmets and cloaks; deep shadow remains cold and dense beyond the gate. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, rain streaks visible, slightly underexposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: Eldric-targeted.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The luminous face that had pointed vaguely north was now turned almost directly toward him.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: disturbed recognition, pupils tight, jaw set. The Beacon on silk is oriented almost directly toward him, cold glow sharpening the edges of his hovering hands near the map without touching; Dulint, Balin, and Xandor blur behind as the room’s attention collapses to that alignment. The Beacon’s blue-white glow throws hard uplight onto fingertips and lower face, while a single candle behind adds warm rim light that separates profile from the dark; amber reflections slide across the map’s waxy surface while blue highlights cut clean along metal seams. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: waiting-at-sunset.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Outside the window, the sun was setting, painting Riverhold in shades of orange and red.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: still calculation, shoulders squared, listening for an approach he cannot see. From inside the upstairs room, he stands at the window looking out over Riverhold rooftops and chimneys washed in orange-red as the sun sinks, long shadows stretching into the streets while the room behind him stays cramped and tense. Sunset light pours in warm and directional, carving a red-gold rim along his profile; interior candles add faint amber fill that reflects on the window glass as soft ghosts, paper edges and dust catching tiny highlights. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, subtle lens flare, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
