1. filename: captains-map.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: flinty focus, jaw working like he's chewing bad news; finger tracing a ridgeline on the map. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: stiff discipline, voice low and controlled. Eldric's desk is covered in overlapping maps with peeling corners, charcoal sketches and crumpled parchment scattered as Varian stands at attention in the damp-smelling quarters. Candle stubs are the only light, warm and close, pooling on parchment and hands, throwing hard shadows across timber walls and leaving the far corners of the room in gloom. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: mist-patrol.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "They walked the old game trails in silence.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: building tension, eyes scanning the shrouds. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: wary focus, spear held tight. Varian and Elric walk old game trails in silence through a skeletal forest as mist curls between trunks and swallows sound, the path disappearing a few steps ahead. Pale morning sun filtered through fog provides diffuse cool light, softening edges while wet leaves and loam catch faint silver highlights at ground level. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: fresh-tracks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The prints were there. Clawed, splayed, and deep.")
prompt:Clawed, splayed footprints press deep into slick loam, edges still wet as water seeps slowly into the depressions, fern fronds and snapped twigs framing the fresh mark. Diffuse mist light is the only illumination, cold and even, grazing the wet mud to create small specular points while the surrounding ground falls to soft shadow. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: outpost-return.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The outpost hunched ahead, a dark shape against the trees.")
prompt:The frontier outpost hunched ahead at dusk, a dark palisade of sharpened logs and a watch platform set against the treeline, small and vulnerable as fog gathers at the forest edge. Dusk and torch baskets provide the only light, cold fading sky behind and flickering warm orange on the palisade faces, smoke catching halation and softening the background. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: yard-report.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric waited in the torchlit yard.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: worry held behind command, gaze distant. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: exhaustion under discipline, shoulders tight. Varian reports in the muddy yard as soldiers gather around cookfires and torches, smoke drifting low and boots tracking filth across the ground, the palisade looming behind. Firelight and torches are the primary light, warm and flickering, throwing moving shadows across faces and wet mud while the forest beyond the gate stays black. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
