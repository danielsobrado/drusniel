## Prologue | Tracks in the Mist

--- 

The captain's quarters smelled of damp timber and stale wax. Maps covered Aldric's desk like scars, overlapping and peeling at the corners where the damp had gotten in. He didn't look up when Varian entered, nor did he acknowledge the stiff salute.

"Tell me," Aldric said, his finger tracing a ridgeline on the parchment.

"More sign, sir," Varian said, keeping his voice level. "Fresh. Within a league of the northern perimeter."

Aldric finally looked up. His eyes were flinty beneath grizzled brows, harsh in the lantern light. "Show me."

Elric stepped forward, unrolling a crumpled sketch of the borderlands. He jabbed a charcoal-stained finger at a spot northeast of the outpost. "Here. Tracks. Droppings. Snapped branches. It’s not just a wandering beast, Captain. It’s a patrol."

Aldric stared at the map. His jaw worked once, twice, like he was chewing on gristle. Goblin incursions had been campfire tales for years—distant threats to frighten green recruits. Now those tales were leaving marks in the loam.

"Double the watch," Aldric said softly to the room at large. Then, sharper: "Tormund, Brynn—pull the men in from the farthest fields. Arm every hand that can hold a spear."

As the others scrambled to obey, Aldric fixed Varian with a look that felt heavier than armor. "You two. Walk the line. Confirm the numbers. But don't you dare play the hero. If the mist moves, you run. Understood?"

"Yes, sir."

***

The forest was silent, the kind of silence that felt distinct from peace. Mist curled between the weathered trunks of the Ironwood trees, dampening sound, turning the world into a gray smudge.

Varian watched the drifting shrouds, tension building behind his eyes. Every shadow seemed to twitch. Beside him, Elric moved with practiced quiet, though his knuckles were white on his spear-haft.

"Eyes sharp," Varian whispered. It was a useless command; they were both staring so hard their eyes watered.

They found it near the old game trail.

Elric froze, hand chopping the air. Varian eased forward, the mud sucking at his boots.

There.

Gouged into the soft earth were prints—splayed, clawed, and deep. The edges were still crisp.

"Goblins," Elric breathed. He crouched, hovering his hand over the impression without touching it. "Small group. Fast."

"Scouts," Varian corrected. "They aren't raiding. They're measuring us."

Elric looked up, his face pale in the gloom. "Testing the fences?"

"Or looking for gaps." Varian straightened, the hair on his arms standing up. The woods felt suddenly crowded, as if a hundred eyes had just opened in the canopy. "We need to get back. Aldric needs to know they aren't just walking the border anymore."

"They're crossing it," Elric finished.

***

Dusk bled across the sky as they returned to the outpost. The wooden palisade hunched against the trees, a dark shape of spiked logs and torches that flickered weakly against the coming night.

Varian’s shirt clung to his back—sweat from tension, cold and clammy. They passed beneath the gate, the heavy thump of the closing bars behind them offering less comfort than it should have.

Aldric was waiting in the yard. He listened to their report in silence, his gaze distant, looking past them into the dark tree line.

"You did well," the Captain said finally. "Get some food. Rest while you can."

They trudged toward the cookfires. The smell of stew—barley and salt pork—hung heavy in the air. It should have been welcoming, but Varian couldn't shake the chill from his bones. He glanced over his shoulder at the palisade wall. Solid timber. Twelve feet high.

It looked flimsy.

"We're not done with this," Elric murmured, mirroring his thought. "Those were scouts. Certain as sunrise. There'll be more."

Varian nodded, watching the sparks from the fire spiral up into the black sky. The real test hadn't started yet.
