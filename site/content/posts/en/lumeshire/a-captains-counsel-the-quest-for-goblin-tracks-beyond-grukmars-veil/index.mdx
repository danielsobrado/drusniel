## Prologue | The Quest for Goblin Tracks Beyond Grukmar's Border

--- 

The captain's quarters squatted at the heart of the outpost—a weathered timber box hunched against the palisade wall. Varian knocked once on the splintered door and entered without waiting. Elric followed a step behind, breathing too loud for a man trying to look calm.

Aldric stood behind a battered desk. Maps and dispatches covered its scarred surface, overlapping like old wounds. Two more guards, Tormund and Brynn, straightened from the far wall as Varian and Elric entered.

Varian saluted, fist to chest. *"Report from the morning patrol, sir."*

Aldric didn't look up from the map. *"Well?"*

*"More goblin sign. Fresh this time. Within a league of the border."*

That got his attention. His head snapped up, eyes flinty beneath grizzled brows. *"Show me."*

Elric stepped forward, unrolling a crumpled parchment—a rough sketch of the borderlands in charcoal. He jabbed a finger at a spot northeast of the outpost.

*"Here. Tracks. Droppings. Snapped branches. Could be a raiding party. Maybe scouts."*

## New Orders

Aldric stared at the map. His jaw worked once, twice, like he was chewing something that wouldn't break down.

Varian watched him. This was what they trained for. What they feared. Goblin incursions had been campfire tales for years—distant threats to frighten green recruits. Now those tales left marks in loam and leaf mould.

*"Double the watch."* Aldric's voice cut through Varian's thoughts. *"Every approach patrolled, day and night. Tormund, Brynn—pull in the men from the farthest fields. Arm every hand that can hold a spear."*

The two guards nodded and moved for the door. Aldric turned back to Varian and Elric.

*"You two walk the northern line. Follow those tracks, but don't range too far. I need numbers, direction, intent if you can guess it."* He paused. *"But don't take foolish chances. We're not hunting glory out here."*

*"Yes sir."* Varian hoped his voice sounded steadier than the thing beating against his ribs.

Aldric held his gaze a moment longer. Something flickered in those hard eyes—there and gone too quick to read.

*"Watch yourselves, lads. First sign of trouble, you get your hides back here. Understood?"*

*"Yes sir."* This from Elric, stiff as new rope.

The captain nodded, already turning back to his maps. *"Good. Off with you."*

## Preparation

They gathered their gear in silence. Oiled leathers. Bows and quivers. Ration packs tight with hard cheese and dried meat. Varian buckled on his sword belt—the weight familiar at his hip, as close to comfort as he was likely to get.

*"Hal. Leofric."* Elric beckoned to two young guards by the armory. *"You're with us. Northern patrol."*

The lads straightened, faces eager over patchy stubble. Barely old enough to shave. But that was the way of it out here. The outpost took whoever the villages could spare—anyone who could swing a sword or draw a bow.

Varian checked his dagger, slid it into his boot. *"Let's move."*

## The Northern Patrol

They walked the old game trails, footfalls hushed by a carpet of dead leaves. The sun rose behind them, casting chill morning light through bare branches. Mist curled between weathered trunks.

Varian watched those drifting shrouds, tension building with each step. Every shadow seemed to twitch.

*"Eyes sharp."* His voice was low, swallowed by the mist. *"First sign of trouble, fall back."*

Nods and grunts. Hands tight on bowstaffs and sword hilts. They walked on.

The stories whispered in Varian's head. Dark legends from late-night fires. Cunning beasts who walked like men. Blood-spattered stones. Glinting eyes peering from darkness.

Children's tales. Meant to frighten and enthrall.

But out here, in this hushed world of mist and shadow, those stories felt like something else entirely.

## The Tracks

Elric raised a fist. The patrol halted, crouching low.

Varian eased forward, heart thumping beneath his leathers. Elric pointed with a jerk of his chin.

There. Gouged in the soft loam. Prints, splayed and clawed, trailing away into the mist.

Varian crouched and studied them. Fresh—the edges crisp and sharp. He touched one. His fingertips came away damp.

A prickle walked up his spine.

*"Goblins. No more than an hour old."*

*"Could be the same band."* Elric kept his voice low. *"Scouting our lines. Testing our resolve."*

*"Or our strength."* Leofric shifted, knuckles pale on his bow grip.

Varian shook his head. *"Too few for that. This is a feint. A prod at our borders. Trying to draw us out, leave the village exposed."*

*"Back to the outpost."* Decision hardened his voice. *"The captain needs to know."*

## Return to the Outpost

Dusk bled across the sky as they walked back in tense silence. Varian's shirt clung to his back—sweat from tension and something colder than fear.

The outpost hunched ahead, a dark shape against the trees. They angled toward it, steps quickening. Varian's gaze flicked to the forest edge and back. Watching. Waiting for something that never showed itself.

The guards on the palisade hailed them, voices harsh with relief. They passed beneath the great spiked logs, feet thumping the packed earth.

Aldric waited in the torchlit yard. Varian and Elric made their report, tongues heavy with exhaustion. The captain listened, gaze distant, seeing something beyond the words.

*"You did well, lads."* His voice was gruff. *"Get some hot food. Rest. I'll want you fresh come morning."*

They trudged toward the cookfires. The smell of stew—barley and salt pork—set Varian's stomach growling. But beneath the hunger, something else lingered. He glanced over his shoulder at the darkness beyond the palisade, half expecting to see eyes staring back.

*"We're not done with this."* Elric spoke low, for Varian's ears alone. *"Those were scouts. Certain as sunrise. There'll be more out there. Biding their time."*

Varian nodded.

The real test was yet to come. And whether they'd be ready for it—that was a question he couldn't answer.
