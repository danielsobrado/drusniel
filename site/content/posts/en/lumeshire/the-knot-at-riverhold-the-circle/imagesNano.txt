1. filename: maris-tells-vision.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: exhausted intensity, hands clasped white-knuckled. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: steady focus, gaze locked on her. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Expression: worn restraint, leaning in. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Expression: tense curiosity, fear muting impatience. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: grave attention, watching faces. In the cramped upstairs room, Maris speaks about black water and a drowning hand while the others lean in around the Beacon on pale silk, maps and scattered papers pushed aside (writing indistinct), candle stubs and wax drips crowding the table edge. Flickering candles cast warm amber across faces and reflect off varnished wood; the Beacon’s cold blue-white glow adds uneasy uplight from below, blue highlights catching undersides of cheekbones and knuckles, halation blooming in smoke-haze while corners fall into shadow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: drowning-hand-detail.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A hand reaching up from beneath the surface... slipping under before anyone could grasp it.")
prompt:Photorealistic water-level macro of thick black water with an oily sheen; a grey-dark hand with long fingers reaches up from beneath the surface, fingertips breaking the waterline for a single desperate moment before slipping under again. Ripples spread outward and fade too quickly, leaving the surface heavy and wrong, like high-viscosity fluid refusing motion. Cold moonlight is the only illumination, dull silver highlights skating across the water skin while everything else falls into near-black; suspended particles catch tiny points of light before vanishing. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: Eldric-maris-connection.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "I believe you, he said. Maris looked at him, surprised.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: direct sincerity, calm set to his mouth. [Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: surprise cracking guarded exhaustion, first recognition in her eyes. Tight two-shot at the table as Eldric meets Maris’s gaze; the Beacon and the others soften into blur behind, the room feeling smaller and quieter. Warm candlelight is the key light on their faces, interactive amber highlights catching pores and wetness at the lower eyelid; the Beacon’s cold blue glow adds a thin rim that outlines cheek and hair, separating them from the shadowed background. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-agreement.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "We stay together, he said.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: decision hardened into leadership. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Expression: slow practical agreement. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Expression: eager assent, relief mixed with fear. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: quiet resolve. [Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: unreadable caution, staying despite distrust. The five stand in a loose circle around the table where the Beacon rests on pale silk, stances angled inward without touching; scattered gear and papers ring the scene. Candlelight warms floorboards and throws long shadows outward; the Beacon’s cold glow adds a blue-white core that lifts faces from below, blue highlights catching undersides of chins and fingers like a ward forming. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: vigil-at-window.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric stared into the dark street and couldn't shake the sense that something out there had already noticed them.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: sleepless vigilance, shoulders rigid, head slightly turned as if he feels eyes on the glass. From a dark alley below, camera looks up at a single lit upper window where Eldric stands inside near the frame, half-lit by candle glow, hand near his belt; wet stone walls and faint mist swallow detail, and a vague out-of-focus foreground edge implies someone watching without showing a clear face. Warm interior candle is the key light in the window; weak street lantern outside adds cold reflections on wet stone and a faint rim along the sill, moisture beads catching tiny specular points. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus foreground. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
