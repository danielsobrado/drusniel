1. filename: maris-tells-vision.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, exhausted intensity; hands clasped white-knuckled as she forces the words out. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Listening with steady focus, gaze locked on her like a promise. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Worn restraint, leaning in despite fatigue. [Face_Reference: Balin] Tense curiosity, impatience muted by fear. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Grave attention, watching faces as much as details. Maris sits at the table in the cramped upstairs room, speaking about black water and a drowning hand while the others lean in, forming a tight circle around the Beacon on pale silk, maps and scattered papers pushed aside (any writing indistinct), candle stubs and wax drips crowding the edges. Flickering candles cast warm amber across their faces while the Beacon’s cold blue-white glow adds uneasy uplight that sharpens cheekbones and knuckles, deepening the room’s shadows. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, halation around the blue glow, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drowning-hand-detail.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A hand reaching up from beneath the surface... slipping under before anyone could grasp it.")
prompt:Photorealistic water-level macro of thick black water with an oily sheen; a grey-dark hand with long fingers reaches up from beneath the surface, fingertips breaking the waterline for a single desperate moment before slipping under again. Ripples spread outward and fade too quickly, leaving the surface heavy and wrong. Cold moonlight provides the only illumination, turning the water’s skin into dull silver highlights while everything else falls into near-black. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: Eldric-maris-connection.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "I believe you, he said. Maris looked at him, surprised.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, direct sincerity; expression steady, voice implied in the calm set of his mouth. [Face_Reference: Maris] Surprise breaking through guarded exhaustion, the first crack of recognition in her eyes. In a tight two-shot at the table, Eldric meets Maris’s gaze as he says he believes her, the Beacon and the others softening into blur behind them; the room feels smaller, quieter, as if the agreement starts here. Warm candlelight becomes the key light on their faces, while the Beacon’s cold blue glow adds a thin rim that outlines cheeks and hair, separating them from the shadowed background. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: the-agreement.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "We stay together, he said.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, decision hardened into leadership. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Slow, practical agreement. [Face_Reference: Balin] Eager assent, relief mixed with fear. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Quiet resolve, chin inclined. [Face_Reference: Maris] Unreadable caution, staying despite distrust. The five of them stand in a loose circle in the cramped room around the table where the Beacon rests on pale silk, their stances angled inward without touching, unity implied by distance closing rather than hands joined; scattered gear and papers ring the scene. Candlelight warms the floorboards and throws long shadows outward, while the Beacon’s cold glow adds a blue-white core that lifts faces from below and makes the circle feel like a ward. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: vigil-at-window.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric stared into the dark street and couldn't shake the sense that something out there had already noticed them.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, sleepless vigilance; shoulders rigid, head slightly turned as if he feels eyes on the glass. From a dark alley below, the camera looks up at a single lit upper window where Eldric stands inside near the frame, half-lit by candle glow, his hand near his belt; the wet stone walls and faint mist below swallow detail, and a vague out-of-focus foreground edge implies someone watching without showing a clear face. A warm interior candle is the key light in the window, while a weak street lantern outside adds cold reflections on wet stone and a faint rim along the sill. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus foreground. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
