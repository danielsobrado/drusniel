1. filename: maris-on-fence.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: too tired to move, head bowed, breath shallow as the vision takes her. Medium shot at the edge of a harvested field as she leans heavily against an old wooden fence post, fingers digging into splintered grain while the landscape behind softens out of focus like the world is receding. Fading golden hour is the key light, warm side illumination catching dew on stubble and the edge of lashes; cool shadow fill keeps her face and clothes subdued, interactive highlights glinting on moisture. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: vision-boat-black-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "It was always the boat. Small, barely big enough for two")
prompt:Photorealistic vision scene: a small weathered wooden boat rocks on thick oily black water with no horizon, just water and a dark twilight sky pressing down; the surface rises and falls like it is breathing and something vast shifts beneath. Unnatural ambient gloom is the only light, cold and starless, turning the water into black glass with hard highlights along each ripple and wet wood grain. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, subtle halation on highlights. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: vision-hand-reaching.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Grey-dark skin. Long fingers. Reaching up through the chaos")
prompt:Photorealistic vision detail: a blue-ash skinned hand with unnaturally long fingers reaches desperately out of black water, grasping at nothing as thick droplets slide off knuckles like oil; the hand trembles, then begins to slip. A cold pale glow from above isolates the hand against swallowing black; the surrounding water stays almost lightless, with interactive reflections trembling along each ripple. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: maris-wakes-gasping.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris came back to herself with a gasp.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: wide-eyed terror as she snaps back, mouth open in a gasp, sweat at hairline; knuckles white around the fence post. Extreme close-up as reality returns in a jolt, the field behind swimming out of focus while hands shake against splintered wood. Late-day sun breaks through and hits one side of her face; cool shadow fill deepens the panic in her eyes, interactive highlights catching sweat. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-walks-on.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Maris started walking again. Riverhold was closer now")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: grim resolve replacing shock, eyes fixed ahead as she keeps walking. Tracking shot as she pushes off the fence post and walks toward the camera across harvested stubble, Riverhold's walls growing more distinct in the background. Evening shadows stretch long, warm light near the horizon fading while the air cools toward grey, interactive sheen flashing in small wet patches. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur in her stride, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
