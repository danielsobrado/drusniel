## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The boat rocks and the black water swells as if breathing; wet wood creaks while a shadow passes beneath the surface without breaking it.
[00:03-00:05] A sudden gust snaps the air; ripples tighten into hard glossy bands and the boat pitches, sending thick droplets sliding like oil.
[00:05-00:08] Something reaches up and misses; the surface folds over the disturbance and returns to an unnatural calm, the boat left empty and rocking.

Slow push-in at water level toward the rocking boat.
Audio: thick water slosh, wood creak, low underwater thrum, wind surge, distant indistinct screaming-like noise overhead. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
