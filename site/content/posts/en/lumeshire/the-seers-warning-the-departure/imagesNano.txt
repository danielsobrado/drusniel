1. filename: group-leaves-riverhold.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint, Maris, Xandor, Balin]. Dawn departure; the five shoulder loaded packs and step out from the inn courtyard onto the road north, posture set with determination and quiet dread as Riverhold's walls fade behind them in thin mist. Cobblestones give way to dusty track and wagon ruts, damp grass at the verge, straps shifting with each step and weapons checked tight. Pale sunrise backlights silhouettes and turns the mist into soft gold haze; cool ambient sky fill preserves detail in cloth and leather, and the backlight creates interactive rim highlights along pack edges and shoulders while shadows stay cool and realistic. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: xandor-plants-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Xandor had his plants secured in a special carrier")
prompt:Specialized leather carrier strapped to a pack, fitted with small glass vials and boxed cuttings wrapped in damp cloth, carefully lashed for travel; fingers adjust a buckle and check padding so nothing clinks or breaks. Leather grain, stitching, and wet leaf surfaces are tack-sharp, background blurred into courtyard stone and moving legs. Morning sun glints on glass with hard specular points and soft reflections; moisture on leaves creates glossy highlights, and the warm light bounces amber into the leather pores while the shadow side stays cool from sky fill. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: beacon-warmth.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The Beacon pulsed in Dulint's pack, its warmth pressing against his back.")
prompt:Close-up on the back of a travel pack as a hand reaches back to touch the spot where the Beacon sits inside, fabric stretched over a hard shape, straps creaking under load. A faint heat shimmer rises off the cloth, and a cold-blue pulse barely leaks through seams like a heartbeat you feel more than see. Cool morning daylight reveals canvas weave and dirt scuffs; the Beacon pulse adds brief icy highlights that skim along stitching and create tiny blue specular edges on nearby buckles, then vanish between pulses. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur in fingertips, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: maris-steady.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The screaming's quieter this morning, Maris said quietly.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Calmer on the surface but still haunted; she walks with eyes fixed on the horizon as wind tugs at loose fabric, mist and pale fields opening ahead. The road texture and drifting fog stay present but secondary, keeping the portrait intimate. Soft daylight from an overcast-bright sky wraps the face with gentle contrast; low sun from behind adds a thin rim that separates her from the grey background and creates interactive edge highlights on hair and collar without turning heroic. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: dulint-final-look-back.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Dulint looked back once as Riverhold's walls shrank behind them.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]. Regret held in check; he turns his head back mid-step, eyes narrowed with duty and fear, Riverhold's wallline and roofs blurred behind him in mist already shrinking with distance. The shoulder strap bites and the jaw flexes as if swallowing words he cannot share. Low morning sun creates a warm rim around profile and a soft flare bloom at frame edge; cool sky fill keeps skin and gear grounded, and the rim light paints interactive highlights along cheek edge and strap fibers while background haze stays diffuse. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
