1. filename: group-leaves-riverhold.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint, Maris, Xandor, Balin] Photorealistic, dawn departure; five travelers shoulder loaded packs and step out from the inn courtyard onto the road north, their posture set with determination and quiet dread as Riverhold's walls fade behind them in thin morning mist. Cobblestones give way to dusty track, wagon ruts, and damp grass at the verge; weapons and bedroll straps shift with each step, and the group spacing shows unspoken tension rather than camaraderie. Pale sunrise from low on the horizon backlights their silhouettes and turns the mist into soft gold haze, while cool ambient sky fill keeps details in gear and faces from falling into black. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: xandor-plants-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Xandor had his plants secured in a special carrier")
prompt:Photorealistic travel detail; close view of a specialized leather carrier strapped to a pack, fitted with small glass vials and boxed cuttings wrapped in damp cloth, carefully lashed so nothing clinks or breaks while walking. Fingers adjust a buckle and check the padding, showing the care of someone protecting living companions rather than tools. Morning light glints on glass and wet leaves, creating tiny specular highlights and soft reflections, while the background falls into blurred courtyard stone and moving legs. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: beacon-warmth.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The Beacon pulsed in Dulint's pack, its warmth pressing against his back.")
prompt:Photorealistic subjective sensation; close-up on the back of a travel pack as a hand reaches back to touch the spot where the Beacon sits inside, fabric pulled tight over a hard shape, straps creaking under the load. A faint heat shimmer or subtle air distortion rises off the cloth, and a cold-blue pulse barely leaks through seams like a heartbeat you can feel more than see. Cool morning daylight provides clean detail in canvas weave and dirt scuffs, while the Beacon's internal pulse adds brief icy highlights that appear and vanish along the stitching line. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur in fingertips, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-steady.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The screaming's quieter this morning, Maris said quietly.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, steadied by less pain; she walks with eyes fixed on the horizon, calmer on the surface but still haunted, breath visible only as a faint suggestion in the cold dawn air. Wind tugs at loose fabric and pushes stray strands back as the road opens ahead through mist and pale fields. Soft daylight from an overcast-bright sky wraps her face with gentle contrast, while low sun from behind adds a thin rim that separates her from the grey background without turning heroic. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: dulint-final-look-back.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Dulint looked back once as Riverhold's walls shrank behind them.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, regret held in check; Dulint turns his head back mid-step, eyes narrowed with duty and fear, as Riverhold's wallline and roofs blur behind him in the mist, already shrinking with distance. The strap on his shoulder bites and his jaw flexes as if swallowing words he cannot share. Low morning sun sits behind and slightly to the side, creating a warm rim around his profile and a soft flare that blooms at the edge of frame, while cool sky fill keeps skin and gear grounded and real. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
