1. filename: beggar-appears.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: startled stillness, breath caught as a stranger appears too close; hands hovering near her coin pouch. Street scene at dusk in Riverhold: Maris backed against a cold stone wall while an old beggar stands in front with a trembling hand extended, eyes rheumy and unfocused, beard matted, clothes stained and damp. Street lamps and nearby window spill are the key sources, warm amber pools catching on wet stone and grime; the rest of the alley stays in cool blue-grey shadow, interactive highlights glinting on moisture. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: coin-transformation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The beggar's fingers closed around the copper. His hand stopped trembling.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on the beggar's dirty hand clutching a copper coin: trembling stops dead, veins and grime sharp, knuckles tightening as if someone else has taken control. High-contrast streetlamp light creates warm specular highlights on the coin edge and wet skin; background falls into deep alley blur, interactive reflections sliding on the coin. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slight vignetting. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: beggar-prophecy.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The drowning. The beggar's eyes were looking through her now")
prompt:Photorealistic extreme close-up on the beggar's face as eyes snap into terrifying focus, clarity replacing the rheumy drift; mouth forming flat words like a script being read through him. A faint cold rim light separates pupils and lashes from darkness, while streetlamp amber catches beard hair and cracked lips, creating a split between ordinary filth and unnatural intent, interactive highlights trembling in the eyes. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, subtle halation on the rim light. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: beggar-wanders-off.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "He wandered off, weaving slightly, already forgetting her face.")
prompt:Photorealistic long shot down a narrow alley as the beggar wanders off weaving slightly, the focus gone from his eyes and the tremor back in his hand; Maris stands in the near foreground out of focus, watching him go with shaking hands. Streetlamp light silhouettes him against thin fog and drifting dust; the alley walls swallow detail into cold shadow, interactive bokeh glints on wet cobbles. Sony A7R V 70mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: wanderers-rest-sign.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Its sign showed a traveler with a walking staff, feet bare")
prompt:Photorealistic low angle looking up at the weathered wooden inn sign for The Wanderer's Rest: painted traveler with walking staff, feet bare, face turned toward a distant horizon (no readable text), iron hooks creaking slightly as it sways. Warm window light spills from behind, casting amber onto peeling paint and wet wood grain; surrounding street falls into cool night shadow, interactive highlights glinting on damp iron. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, subtle lens flare from the window, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
