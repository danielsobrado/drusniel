## Chapter 16 | Part 4

--- 

Maris found him that night.

Dulint had taken first watch—not because it was his turn, but because sleep wouldn't come anyway. She appeared from the shadows of their makeshift camp, moving quietly, settling beside him without invitation.

"You don't sleep either," she said.

"Old dwarves and seers." He almost smiled. "Neither of us rest easy."

"You see things too." It wasn't a question. "I can tell. The way you stare at nothing. The way you carry weight no one else can see."

Dulint was quiet for a long moment. The Beacon pulsed nearby, its soft glow a constant reminder of everything they were running toward.

"I see fire," he admitted finally. "Stonehold burning. My people dying. My nephew—" He stopped.

"Your visions show you what might happen."

"Someone else's visions." He looked at her—really looked, seeing the exhaustion, the pain, the strength that kept her moving despite it all. "I went to a seer. Before we started this. She told me... things."

"What things?"

*Tell her. Share the burden. Let someone else carry this.*

But he could see how she'd react. The fear. The urgency. The desperate need to move faster, to prevent the worst.

"She told me warnings. About what could happen if we fail." He chose his words carefully. "About what it would cost."

"And you're not telling the others."

"No."

"That's not your choice to make." Her voice was sharp. "Their lives. Their futures. They deserve to know what they're risking."

"Knowing would make you rush." Dulint's voice was heavy. "You'd push for speed, for action. You'd take risks that shouldn't be taken."

"Maybe. Or maybe we'd be better prepared."

"The seer was very specific. Speed kills. Caution saves." He met her eyes. "I can't control what I know. But I can control how it affects the others."

"By lying to them."

"By protecting them."

Maris was quiet for a long time. When she spoke again, her voice was softer, but no less certain.

"That's still not your choice."

"I know." Dulint turned back to the darkness beyond their camp. "It's the only choice I have."

She looked at him like she knew there was more. There was always more.

He couldn't give it to her.
