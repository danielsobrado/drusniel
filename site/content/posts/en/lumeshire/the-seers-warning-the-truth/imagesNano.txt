1. filename: dulint-maris-campfire.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Maris]. Dulint: tired eyes, guarded jaw; Maris: exhausted but steady, intent gaze. They sit close on first watch beside low embers, a hushed confession hanging between them. Sparse makeshift camp: bedrolls and packs in a rough circle, damp grass and dirt, tree silhouettes and open night beyond the fire's reach; the Beacon kept nearby inside a cloth-wrapped pack. Fire embers cast warm orange up-light that catches undersides of cheekbones and fingers, flickering interactive highlights across canvas weave and scuffed leather; cold moonlight adds a thin silver rim on shoulders, while the Beacon's blue pulse threads through cloth and paints faint icy specular on metal buckles. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: beacon-glows-in-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The Beacon pulsed nearby, its soft glow a constant reminder")
prompt:Beacon pulse seeping through wrapped cloth inside a travel pack, illuminating frayed stitching, heavy canvas weave, leather straps, and nearby gear edges (boot leather, metal buckle, blade sheath). The Beacon's cold blue-white internal light pushes through the fabric with soft subsurface scattering, creating layered gradients in the cloth; hard-edged shadows fall onto adjacent objects, and thin icy highlights skim along worn metal edges while a faint warm spill from the campfire adds amber contamination at the frame edge. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-sees-vision.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "I see fire, he admitted finally. Stonehold burning.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Eyes glossy, brows pulled tight; she leans toward Dulint as he admits the vision of fire, holding her alarm under control. The camp behind her falls into darkness, only embers and scattered gear catching light; the Beacon pulse continues nearby like a cold heartbeat. Firelight from below warms lower planes of face and hands, creating orange highlights under cheekbones and knuckles; moonlight adds a cool rim along the far cheek and shoulder, and the Beacon's blue pulse adds faint cold catchlights that reflect as tiny icy points in the eyes. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: dulint-hides-truth.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "I can't control what I know. But I can control how it affects the others.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]. Jaw locked, eyes hard; he turns away from Maris and stares into the darkness beyond the camp, one hand tightening on a strap or weapon haft, then holding still. Long moving shadows from the fire crawl across damp ground and the nearest packs, emphasizing the distance he creates by looking away. Cold moonlight outlines the profile from behind with a thin silver edge; the campfire adds warm amber edge-light on cheek and knuckles, and the mixed sources create blue-tinged shadows that pulse subtly with the flame flicker. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-watches-dulint.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "She looked at him like she knew there was more.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris, Dulint]. Maris: expression tight with judgment and sorrow; Dulint: back turned, shoulders held firm as he faces the dark. She watches him without speaking, hands held still as if forcing herself not to reach for him. The fire has sunk lower and the camp feels smaller, gear scuffs and dirt grit visible on packs; the Beacon pulse continues inside the pack. Fading firelight provides weak warm fill that flickers across Maris's eyes and catches on worn leather edges; moonlight builds a cold rim on Dulint's shoulders and the treeline, deepening the shadow gap between them, while the Beacon's blue pulse adds faint icy spill on nearby cloth folds. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur from fire flicker, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
