1. filename: dulint-sleepless-by-hearth.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Sleepless tension; posture rigid, eyes fixed on the dying fire, hands clenched together as if holding back panic that would make others move too fast. Late-night inn common room with empty tables and benches receding into shadow, candle stubs and soot marks in the timber, a draft tugging at the door latch, and dust hanging in the air. Ember coals provide warm orange uplight that catches the undersides of cheekbones and knuckles and throws dancing shadows up the walls; faint cold moonlight from a distant window adds a thin blue rim on shoulders and chair edges, with subtle reflections shimmering on worn varnished wood. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: balin-comes-downstairs.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He heard footsteps on the stairs and forced his face still.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Balin]. Forced calm and quiet worry; Dulint holds his face still like a practiced lie, Balin comes down the stairs slowly with a creased brow and a hesitating step when he sees the lone figure by the embers. Inn stairwell angle framing the empty room and hearth corner, scuffed travel gear near the wall, dust motes drifting in still air. Warm ember flicker from the hearth skims the floorboards and catches on boot edges; a dim lantern on the stairs spills weak yellow light downward, creating interactive highlights along Balin's outline and a soft back rim on Dulint while the rest of the room stays dense and dark. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dulint-forces-calm.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The lie came easily, worn smooth from repetition.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Calm that costs him; jaw clenched and eyes tired as he delivers a lie worn smooth by repetition, a flicker of strain tightening the eyes before it is forced away. Tight portrait with benches and soot-stained walls falling into soft bokeh, ash dust settled on table edge and sleeve cuffs. Hearth embers provide warm orange low flicker that paints moving highlights under the cheekbones and along fingers; faint cold window spill adds a thin blue rim along temple and shoulder and deepens the far-side shadow, with moisture sheen on skin catching tiny specular points. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: embers-stonehold-vision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "When Balin was gone, Dulint turned back to the dying fire.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Dread returning; he leans forward and stares into the embers as if they can answer him, eyes reflecting firelight and a memory he cannot unsee. Over-the-shoulder view into the hearth where heat shimmer and shifting flame patterns briefly align into the suggestion of burning stone corridors and running silhouettes, like pareidolia in smoke, then collapse back into ordinary fire; ash drifts up and the room stays still. Ember glow is the only strong illumination, creating warm orange specular highlights that skate across soot-blackened stone and reflect in wet eyes; faint cold window spill adds a minimal rim on the shoulder edge and turns the deeper room into blue-grey near-black. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: dulint-carries-it-alone.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He would carry this alone.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Decision to carry it alone; shoulders heavy, hands clasped, eyes fixed on the last coals as if measuring how much time is left before morning forces motion. Empty common room with chairs pushed in, candle stubs cold, soot in the wood grain, and the door draft making the ember glow pulse and dim. The hearth embers give the last warm orange uplight from low right, catching undersides of knuckles and casting long soft shadows; faint moonlight through a distant window adds cold fill that reflects as thin blue highlights on table edges and leaves the far corners in blue-grey silence. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
