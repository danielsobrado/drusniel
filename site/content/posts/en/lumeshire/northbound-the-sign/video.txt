## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Eldric throws his fist up and the whole group freezes mid-step, boots stopping on damp needles as the birds cut off at once.
[00:03-00:05] He drops to one knee and drags a finger through moss and pressed earth, eyes narrowing; Balin leans in and still can't see what Eldric sees.
[00:05-00:08] Maris turns toward the east, breath catching as if something presses on her senses; Eldric rises and signals them forward toward defensible ground, and they move again with slower, quieter steps.

Handheld.
Audio: boots on needles, wet leaf rustle, birdsong cut, fingertip scrape in dirt, a distant twig snap, shallow breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
