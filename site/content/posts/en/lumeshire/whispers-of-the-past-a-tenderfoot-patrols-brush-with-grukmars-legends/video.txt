## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The ale surface ripples as Varian's grip tightens on the mug. Firelight skates across the liquid in restless bands.
[00:03-00:05] The reflection distorts further, briefly forming a clawlike shape that seems to reach upward before breaking apart into normal ripples. A coal pops in the hearth, showering tiny sparks.
[00:05-00:08] Varian exhales and the mug steadies, but the firelight flickers again and the surface darkens as if something passes between flame and glass; conversation behind him fades to a dull murmur.

Slow dolly-in from the mug rim to the reflection.
Audio: hearth crackle, one sharp coal pop, low tavern murmur, mug scrape on wood, Varian's steady breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
