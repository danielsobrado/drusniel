## Prologue | A Tenderfoot Patrol's Brush with Grukmar's Legends

--- 

The Rusty Axe squatted at the village's edge, its wooden walls weathered by seasons beyond counting. Varian ducked under the low doorway, Elric at his heels. Five other guards already hunched around a table near the hearth, drinking from chipped mugs.

*"No goblins yet."* Varian shrugged off his cloak, shaking free a fine mist. *"Maybe we'll get a quiet night."*

*"Quiet."* Elric snorted. *"And I'm the emperor of [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)."*

Varian glanced at him, then turned to the barkeep. *"Ale. Two."*

They squeezed onto the bench, knees and elbows jostling. The tavern air hung thick with sweat and sour beer. At the far end of the room, an old minstrel coaxed a mournful tune from a battered lute.

## Rumors of Darkness

Varian took a pull of ale and grimaced at its bitter bite. Across the table, Tormund leaned forward, voice low.

*"You lads hear about the goblins in the east? Near [Stonehold](https://www.drusniel.com/forge-and-fire-the-mountain-kingdom-of-stoneholds-stand-against-chaos/)?"*

Varian frowned. *"What about them?"*

*"Word is they made some kind of deal. With the orcs."*

*"Orcs?"* Elric looked up, wiping foam from his lip. *"What would goblins do with such creatures?"*

*"Dark magic, some say."* Tormund's eyes glinted in the firelight. *"Some kind of ritual. Tied them together. Made them stronger."*

*"Goblins can barely find their own arses with both hands."* Brynn, a hulking redhead, snorted into his mug. *"You expect me to believe they're suddenly making deals and doing magic?"*

*"I'm just telling you what I heard."* Tormund spread his hands. *"People been disappearing from villages up there. Something's riled them up."*

## Elara's Whispers

*"There's more."*

Elara's voice was soft but carrying. The others turned to look. The only woman in their group, she'd proven herself twice over—with blade and bow. She had a strange skill for finding gossip that turned out to be something else.

*"They say the goblins have shamans now. Witches who can call up storms and ruin crops with a word."* She glanced around the table, firelight dancing in her dark eyes. *"They say they kill captives for their gods. Paint their offering slabs with blood. Hang skulls on their totems."*

Silence fell heavy as a shroud.

Varian let it sit. He wasn't going to be the first one to admit how much that bothered him.

## Doubt and Unease

Brynn broke the quiet with a forced laugh. *"You don't believe that nonsense, do you? Stories. That's all."*

*"Stories got to come from somewhere,"* Tormund muttered.

*"From drunk fools and crazy women."* Brynn took a long pull of ale. *"You can't believe every wild tale that comes down the road."*

*"But what about the captain's orders?"* Elric spoke up. *"Double watches. No one past the village edges. He's not doing that over stories."*

*"The captain's just being careful,"* Brynn said. But doubt had crept into his voice.

Varian said nothing. He stared into the depths of his mug, watching firelight play on the dark surface.

The stories chased themselves around his mind. Old superstitions, he told himself. No sensible man believed such tales.

Yet.

He thought of the tracks they'd found, fresh in the loam. The claw marks on tree trunks—too high for any natural beast. The eerie silence in the forest, as if the very birds and insects held their breath.

*"Another round,"* Varian called to the barkeep.

He needed a drink to wash away what lingered on his tongue. It tasted like doubt. Or maybe like something worse.

As the mugs were refilled, conversation drifted to safer topics. Harvests. Village gossip. Sweethearts left behind. Dreams of glory.

But beneath it all, the current ran dark.

Outside, beyond the tavern's weathered walls, night pressed close. Shadows lengthened toward the village. And in the depths of [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) forest, the trees stood silent.

Whatever watched from between them wasn't sharing its secrets.
