1. filename: inn-common-room.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, cautious hesitation at the threshold; eyes adjusting, shoulders tight as she steps into warmth she doesn't trust. Wide shot of The Wanderer's Rest common room: crowded tables of merchants and locals, serving girls weaving through, a large hearth fire burning while lanterns glow overhead; Maris stands just inside the doorway in travel-stained clothes, ignored like any other traveler. Hearth fire and lanterns provide warm amber pools and flicker across faces and wood, while cooler dusk light from the open door edges Maris in faint blue-grey rim. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight lens flare from the hearth, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: xandor-with-plants.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "An elderly man sat alone at a corner table, surrounded by—yes, plants.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, calm certainty in a crowded room; eyes pale and attentive, hands gentle as he works. Medium shot in the back corner booth as Xandor sits alone surrounded by small pots of herbs and unfamiliar plants, murmuring while he adjusts leaves with practiced precision. A single candle on the table provides intimate warm light that catches plant moisture and the lines of his hands, while hearth glow gives soft ambient fill from the room behind. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: xandor-pale-eyes.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "His eyes were pale, almost colorless")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, eyes pale and almost colorless but razor sharp; focus landing on Maris with unsettling accuracy. Extreme close-up on his eyes with the candle flame reflected as a small warm point, the rest of the inn falling away into darkness. Candlelight is the key source, warm and low, catching lashes and fine skin texture while leaving the surrounding shadows deep. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: plant-ritual-pattern.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Up close, she could see that his plants were arranged in a pattern")
prompt:Photorealistic top-down view of Xandor's corner table: small plant pots arranged in a deliberate geometric pattern, leaves positioned like markers in a ritual configuration, with a few faintly glowing tips. Xandor's hands adjust one pot by a finger's width, careful and precise, while wax drips and crumbs of soil sit between the circles. Candlelight provides warm amber from one side, while the plants add subtle cool bioluminescence that creates thin highlights on wet leaves and ceramic rims. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation on the glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-choice-made.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "And Maris Hale made her choice.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, determination set hard over exhaustion; leaning forward, refusing to look away. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Still and attentive, letting her choose without pushing, hands paused over the plants. Over-the-shoulder from Xandor toward Maris as she sits opposite him, elbows on the table, the inn's crowd dissolving into soft blur behind her. Table candlelight is the key source, warm and steady on her face, while hearth flicker adds faint moving highlights on glass and plant leaves at frame edge. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
