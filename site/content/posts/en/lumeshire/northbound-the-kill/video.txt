## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Balin stands alone in the clearing, sword on the ground, staring at the body just off frame as misty breath hangs in the cold air.
[00:03-00:05] Eldric steps in, grips Balin's shoulder, and pulls him away while Balin forces himself to look forward; the dead Grukmar stays behind in shallow focus.
[00:05-00:08] They start moving, Maris joining on Balin's other side; the camera pulls back to show the group leaving the clearing while carrion birds begin to circle above.

Pull back.
Audio: wet leaves under boots, distant crow call, shallow breathing, quiet metal clink, soft wind through trees. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
