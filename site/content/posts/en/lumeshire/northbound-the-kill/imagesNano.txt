1. filename: staring-at-body.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Standing alone, sword dropped, eyes locked on the body out of frame; hands hanging, breath visible. Small clearing gone silent, trampled grass and wet branches still dripping. Cold grey overcast light flattens color; damp ground reflects soft specular glints where blood mixes with dew and bounces faint cool highlights onto his knuckles. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: grukmar-dead-eyes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The way its eyes had gone flat and empty.")
prompt:High-angle close-up of the dead Grukmar: glassy eyes open, mouth slack, war paint streaked with mud and blood, features vulnerable in death. Flat overcast light leaves pale reflections in pupils and damp sheen on skin; wet grass and dark blood frame the face with cool greens and near-black pools, and moisture catches tiny specular points along brow ridges. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: balin-vomits.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Balin barely made it three steps before he was on his knees")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Knees in wet grass, retching, shoulders shaking, one hand clawed into the ground. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Hand on Balin's shoulder, other hand on sword, eyes scanning. Dappled canopy shade mixes with cool overcast, so mottled light hits Balin while damp soil throws small specular highlights on blades of grass and the trembling hilt. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in Eldric’s sword hand, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: maris-haunted.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris fell into step beside him. Her face was pale, eyes haunted.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Pale, eyes distant and haunted. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Numb, jaw clenched, stare ahead. They walk side by side down the forest path, gear heavy, shoulders almost touching. Fading daylight cools toward blue, catching cheekbones and damp cloaks; wet leaves reflect small silver highlights at their feet while background trees fall into dark blur. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: leaving-the-dead.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The Grukmar body would feed scavengers by nightfall.")
prompt:Wide shot: Grukmar body small in grass beside a dark blood patch; carrion birds start circling high. Far down the trail, the group are tiny silhouettes moving away as the forest closes behind. Low sunset breaks through clouds, casting long cool shadows and a thin warm rim on distant figures; wet ground reflects muted highlights where blood mixes with dew. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
