1. filename: staring-at-body.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Standing alone in a small clearing, sword dropped in the grass, eyes locked on the unseen body just out of frame; hands hanging, breath visible in the cold. The forest has gone silent, branches still dripping from the earlier fight, and a wide circle of trampled grass marks where the ambush broke. Cold grey overcast light flattens colors and paints a faint rim on Balin's cheeks and knuckles; damp ground throws soft specular glints where blood and dew mix. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: grukmar-dead-eyes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The way its eyes had gone flat and empty.")
prompt:Photorealistic high-angle close-up of the dead Grukmar's face, eyes open and glassy, mouth slack, war paint streaked by mud and blood; death makes the features look vulnerable and almost human. Flat overcast light eliminates harsh shadow, leaving pale reflections in the pupils and damp sheen on skin; wet grass and dark blood frame the face with cool greens and near-black pools. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: balin-vomits.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Balin barely made it three steps before he was on his knees")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, On his knees, retching, shoulders shaking, one hand dug into wet grass. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Beside him, one hand on Balin's shoulder, the other holding his sword ready, gaze scanning the trees with guarded sympathy. Dappled shadow under the canopy mixes with cool overcast, leaving Balin in mottled light while damp earth and trampled leaves show the fight's aftermath. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in Eldric’s sword hand, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-haunted.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris fell into step beside him. Her face was pale, eyes haunted.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Pale, eyes distant and haunted, mouth a tight line. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Numb, stare unfocused ahead, jaw clenched. They walk side by side away from camera along a forest trail, gear hanging heavy, shoulders brushing but not touching. Fading late-day light cools toward blue, catching on their cheekbones and damp cloaks; background trees blur into dim shapes as the path darkens. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: leaving-the-dead.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The Grukmar body would feed scavengers by nightfall.")
prompt:Photorealistic wide landscape; the Grukmar body lies small in the grass near a blood-dark patch while carrion birds begin to circle high above. Far down the trail, the group is reduced to tiny silhouettes moving away, the forest closing behind them. Low sunset light breaks through clouds, casting long cold shadows over the clearing and a faint warm rim on distant figures; wet ground reflects muted highlights where blood and dew mix. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
