## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The underbrush explodes and Balin swings on instinct; the impact jolts his arms and hot breath catches as dark spray hits his cheek.
[00:03-00:05] The attacker grabs his sword arm and yanks him forward; a cleaver-whistle cuts past as Eldric slams into Balin from the side, driving both of them into wet leaves.
[00:05-00:08] Balin scrambles up, shakes his head once, and thrusts again with shaking hands; the attacker drops and Eldric hauls him backward without letting him look, dragging him into the moving knot of the fight.

Handheld.
Audio: underbrush crash, boots on wet leaves, metal clash, heavy breathing, a dull thud, fabric rip, distant animal panic. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
