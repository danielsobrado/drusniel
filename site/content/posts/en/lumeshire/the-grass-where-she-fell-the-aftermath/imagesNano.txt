1. filename: waking-in-field.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: disoriented pain and raw confusion, dirt smeared on cheek, hair tangled, breath shallow. High angle looking down on her lying in wet grass and harvested stubble outside Riverhold, fingers curled into soil that squelches; a bird calls nearby as if nothing happened. Low golden sun is the key source, warm light catching dew and throwing long shadows; cool shadow fill keeps her clothes and skin cold, interactive highlights sparkling in droplets. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: blood-on-fingers.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Her fingers came away with the copper taste of blood.")
prompt:Photorealistic visceral macro: fingers touch lips and tongue, coming away with bright blood on the fingertips; the field behind is a soft blur of wet grass and stubble. Soft golden hour sunlight rakes across skin texture and the wet shine of blood, interactive specular points catching on moisture; cool shadow fill keeps the background subdued. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: riverhold-in-distance.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The town's silhouette was visible against the horizon")
prompt:Photorealistic wide shot from behind Maris as she stands unsteadily in a harvested field and stares toward Riverhold in the distance, town walls and rooftops a dark silhouette against the low sun. Backlit golden hour sun turns drifting haze into warm flare; the field foreground stays textured with scratchy stubble and damp soil, interactive highlights glinting in dew. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: vision-fragment-hand.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A hand—grey-dark skin, long fingers—slipping beneath the surface")
prompt:Photorealistic vision fragment: a blue-ash skinned hand with long fingers slips beneath oily black water, surface tension behaving wrong as the liquid folds over knuckles like thick oil; chaos ripples around the wrist and then swallows it. Unnatural cold glow from below is the only light, turning the water into black glass with hard highlights and leaving everything above in darkness, interactive reflections trembling along each ripple. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle halation on the glow. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-walks-shakily.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Each step was a negotiation with a body that wanted nothing more than to lie back down")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: exhausted but determined, jaw clenched, eyes fixed toward Riverhold. Side tracking shot as she walks through stubble that scratches her ankles, stumbling once and catching herself, wet grass brushing her boots while the field slopes toward the distant town. Fading golden light turns colder by the minute, long shadows stretching beside her; interactive sheen flashes in tiny puddles where her boots press. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in a swinging hand, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
