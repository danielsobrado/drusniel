1. filename: zuraldi-overview.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Anja] Wind-squint, steady focus; one arm extended in a firm point toward the mountain gaps. Anja stands on a high granite cliff with an apprentice beside her, looking out over Zuraldi: dense forest canopy like a green sea broken by silver river bends and clearings, Stonehold peaks sharp and snow-capped on the far horizon. Bright high-altitude daylight makes the air crisp and clear, lighting the canopy in hard greens and catching snowfields on the distant peaks while deep blue shadows settle in the lee faces. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight atmospheric haze. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: caravan-trade.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Marta, the trade matriarch, stood at the head of the caravan.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Marta] Sharp-eyed pride; stance planted; handshake firm. At a rocky mountain pass, Marta seals a trade greeting with a dwarven merchant whose beard is braided with gold thread while wagons and mountain ponies queue behind them; crates of dwarven metalwork are unloaded as sacks of grain and barrels of salted meat are loaded in return. Golden-hour sun slants through the pass and gilds dust in the air, throwing long warm shadows across rock while the cliff faces above fall into cold blue skylight. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: feast-of-strength.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The air filled with the sizzle of meat and the rich aroma of roasting beef.")
prompt:Village feast around a massive central fire pit: ember glow turns the iron spits red while huge cuts of beef roast and drip; a broad-armed butcher carves thick slabs from a charred side, steam and grease rising as villagers crowd in with wooden plates. Firelight provides hot orange uplight that makes smoke and sparks glow, while the last blue of dusk hangs at the edge of the scene and cools the shadows beyond the pit. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation in sparks. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: magda-green-fire.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "She raised her gnarled staff, and the flames of the central fire turned an eerie green.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Magda] Expression: intent, unblinking; staff held high with absolute certainty. Night ritual in the village center as the bonfire snaps from warm amber to sickly green, throwing long unnatural shadows across recoiling faces and timber walls; smoke spirals upward like a column lit from within. The green fire becomes the only light, washing skin tones strange and casting sharp-edged shadows that stretch farther than they should; faint embers flicker in the green as if the color has replaced heat. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: xandor-druids.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Xandor, his beard now more white than gray, led the circle.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Expression: calm authority; hands steady on his staff as if bracing for resistance. Deep forest clearing at dawn: Xandor leads a circle of strong, calloused druids in leaf mantles while a young druid presses her palm to an ancient oak and the bark ripples in response; the air holds damp earth and fern scent. Dawn shafts pierce the canopy in warm bands that cut through deep green shade, catching the ripple on the bark as a moving highlight while everything outside the beam falls to cool shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
