## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Maris sways in the doorway and takes one unsteady step forward, fingers scraping the doorframe as she tries to stay upright; candlelight flickers across her face.
[00:03-00:05] The Beacon pulses brighter and the air shimmers with heat above the table; Maris’s unfocused eyes snap briefly toward the glow, as if pulled by a hook.
[00:05-00:08] Eldric shifts to block the threshold, hand near his belt, while Balin moves to help and stops short; Maris exhales hard and grips the frame again, the room going silent.

Slow dolly-in from the dark hallway toward Maris as she enters.
Audio: stair creak, door hinge groan, candle hiss, rising artifact hum, cloth rustle, a single sharp breath, distant street noise muffled. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
