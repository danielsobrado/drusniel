1. filename: camp-after-battle.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Calm, intent, hands steady as he wraps Eldric’s arm; shoulders tight with the strain of command. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Jaw set against pain, eyes focused forward. [Face_Reference: Dulint, Balin, Maris] Slumped close by, bruised and dirt-streaked, watching or staring past the moment. They shelter at dusk under a rocky overhang; gear and bloodied bandages lie scattered on damp stone while the artifact-packed bag rests between them. Cold twilight paints everything in blue-grey; a hooded lantern leaks a narrow amber slit across bandages and wet rock, catching on eyes and knuckles. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: dulint-broken.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "His face looked older than it had that morning—lined with something beyond exhaustion.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Eyes closed, lines deeper, clutching the pack to his chest as if it could vanish; breath held, lips pressed thin. He sits against rough stone inside the shelter, knees up, fingers whitening on the strap. Twilight blue rolls across his face while a single lantern sliver rims cheek and knuckles; damp basalt behind him returns a cool sheen and tiny droplets catch the light. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-isolation.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Maris sat apart from the others, knees drawn to her chest")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Knees hugged tight, cloak wrapped, eyes unfocused on a dark patch of ground; lips barely parted like she’s holding back words. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Blurred over-shoulder silhouette in foreground, head turned toward her. She sits a few paces from the fireless camp on cold moss and stone; distance between her and the others is visible void. Moonlight threads through sparse branches, tracing her cheekbone and cloak hem while the rest falls into deep shadow; faint breath fog curls in the chill. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: balin-phantom-blood.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Balin looked at his hands. Still stained, despite the water")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, POV on his own hands held up before him; skin clean but a phantom smear of red clings in his mind, thumbs rubbing it raw, jaw tense at frame edge. He kneels on wet stone; the artifact’s pack and a hooded lantern sit nearby, their glow catching moisture and the imagined blood sheen in skin texture. Lantern edge-light creates cool blue shadows and a thin amber rim on fingers; background moss and rock fall out of focus. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: broken-survivors.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "They were a collection of broken people carrying a burden they didn't choose.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin, Dulint, Eldric, Maris, Xandor] The five huddle beneath the overhang with space between their gazes—each looking elsewhere, hands idle, faces hollow; the artifact pack sits like a small anchor at center. Twilight deepens to near-night; a single hooded lantern casts minimal warm spill on cheek edges while the surrounding forest presses in as blue-black silhouettes. Damp ground reflects tiny amber and cyan highlights, and faint breath fog hangs in the cold. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
