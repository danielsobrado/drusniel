## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Water beads tremble on the edges of the footprint as a faint gust ripples the grass. Mud slowly slumps inward, threatening to soften the sharp ridges.
[00:03-00:05] A boot steps into frame beside the print and stops. Another pair of boots shifts behind it, careful not to smear the mark.
[00:05-00:08] The camera reveals the treeline beyond as the wind dies again. A single twig snaps from the forest, and everyone freezes; the footprint begins to fill with seeped water.

Slow pull-back from macro to include the surrounding boots and the treeline.
Audio: wet mud squelch, leather and buckle creaks, distant wind through pine, soft drip of water, one sharp twig snap. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
