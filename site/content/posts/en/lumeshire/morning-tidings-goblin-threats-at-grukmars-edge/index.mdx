## Prologue | Goblin Threats at Grukmar's Edge

--- 

Mud pulled at Varian's boots in slow, greedy tugs as he climbed toward the outpost. Elric followed a step behind, breathing through his nose like the air itself offended him.

Varian's thumb kept circling the sword pommel. Once. Twice. Again.

The girl's eyes had lodged behind his own. Not fear in the abstract. Fear with a shape. Fear that stared past him at the treeline as if the trees were a doorway.

*"Sleep?"* Elric asked, voice rough.

*"No."*

*"Same."*

After that, words felt like noise you made right before something found you.

The outpost walls rose ahead, logs set upright, rope-bound, patched where old winters had split them. It had "held the border" the way a thin door held back a storm: mostly by insisting it mattered.

At the gate, the sentries looked awake in the way exhausted men did—eyes open, minds somewhere else.

Alden waited by the captain's door, both hands on his spear. Not leaning. Bracing. His face had lost its color, and that did more to Varian than any alarm bell.

*"Report,"* Varian said, and hated that his voice sounded like Elric's when he was trying to be brave.

*"Riders. Frontier villages."*

*"Goblins?"* Elric said, and the word broke anyway.

Alden swallowed. *"They're with the captain. That's all I know."*

## The Captain's Orders

Varian knocked once and went in because waiting for permission felt like a luxury.

Captain Aldric stood behind the desk, hands flat on the wood. Two men in mud-spattered cloaks faced him, shoulders rounded like they'd been carrying something heavy for miles.

*"...three more cattle,"* one man said. *"Throats opened."*

Aldric looked up once. Grave didn't cover it. His expression was the same one he wore before storms hit the wall.

*"Varian. Elric."* Two names, clean and clipped. He motioned them closer without wasting a word on greeting.

*"Goblins?"* Varian asked.

The room didn't react like it had heard a rumor. It reacted like it had heard a schedule.

*"Likely."* Aldric didn't pace. He didn't fidget. He only turned one of the mud-cloaked men's words over like a coin he didn't trust. *"Tracks near the bodies. No sightings."*

*"They didn't take the meat,"* Elric said, because he was fast enough to see the wrong part.

The rider nodded. *"Left them where they fell."*

Varian felt the silence land on his shoulders.

The girl's scream wasn't a sound anymore. It was a pressure behind his ribs.

*"Sir. Village incident last night."* Varian forced himself to say it straight.

He kept it short. Girl. Square. Clawing at air. No footprints. No attacker.

He didn't say how her eyes had fixed on the forest like she'd seen something leaning between the trunks.

Aldric's gaze didn't soften. It sharpened.

*"No tracks,"* Aldric repeated, as if testing the sentence for weakness. *"No sign."*

*"None."* Varian swallowed. *"But she stared at the trees like they were standing too close."*

Aldric dismissed the riders with a nod that meant: go, before fear spreads.

When the door shut, he didn't sag. He didn't show the weight. That was the point of him.

*"This is bad,"* Aldric said.

He didn't lower his voice for drama. He lowered it because men listened harder when a commander stopped filling the room.

*"Panic kills faster than goblins. We don't feed it."*

*"Orders?"* Elric asked.

*"Double the watch. Patrol in pairs. No one alone."* Aldric pointed with two fingers—north wall, east treeline, the gap where the fence line always failed. *"Full sweep of the border. Methodical."*

*"We're short,"* Varian said. He hated how small the words sounded next to the problem.

*"I know."* Aldric's eyes flicked to Elric. *"Get hands from the village. Now."*

Then his gaze pinned both of them.

*"No one crosses into [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)."*

He didn't say it like a superstition. He said it like a boundary line on a map that existed because men died past it.

*"We watch. We guard. We don't go hunting."*

*"Yes sir."* The words sat heavy in Varian's mouth. [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) territory. The thought alone made his skin tighten.

## Preparations

They spent the next hour walking the outpost border. Checking the wall meant finding the weak spots—too many of them. Logs and rope and the stubborn belief that it mattered. That was all that stood between them and that vast dark line of trees to the north.

Every time Varian's eyes drifted up, they went straight to the treeline. He wasn't searching for anything specific. That was the problem.

By midmorning they'd gathered a dozen men. Villagers, most of them. White-knuckled grips on spears and axes. Some looked barely old enough to shave. All of them looked like they'd already decided something was wrong and were waiting to find out what.

*"You know why you're here."* Varian's mouth had gone dry. Blank faces stared back. He pushed on. *"Trouble on the frontier. Attacks. The captain needs hands."*

No whispers. That was worse than whispers.

*"Four-hour shifts. Experienced guard with you at all times. Eyes open."* He paused. *"Questions?"*

Silence. He hadn't expected anything else.

*"Elric will assign posts."*

## The Waiting

The sun climbed higher—a cold eye behind scudding clouds. Varian paced the village edge until his legs ached. Every shadow looked like it was waiting for something. Every rustle of leaves sounded like the first syllable of a word he didn't want to hear.

By dusk he found Elric in the armory, running a whetstone along his blade. Slow strokes. Methodical. The sound was almost calming.

*"Quiet?"*

*"So far."* Elric didn't look up.

*"Feels wrong. Like waiting for a storm you can smell but can't see."*

The whetstone paused. Elric tested the edge against his thumb. Resumed.

*"Captain's orders were clear."*

*"I know what the orders were."* Varian couldn't keep the edge from his voice. *"But if there are goblins out there—"*

*"What? You want to go hunting in [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)?"* Elric met his eyes. *"We don't cross that line. You know that."*

*"And when they cross it first?"*

A long pause. When Elric spoke again, his voice was quiet but steady. *"Then we'll be ready."*

## Night Watch

First watch they took together. The sun bled red and gold across the horizon, and then it was gone. The forest lay utterly still. No wind. No birdsong. Nothing but the creak of their boots on old wood and the sound of their own breathing.

Every snapping twig sent hands flying to hilts.

True dark came. With it, the torches. Varian stared into the gloom beyond their flickering light, half-convinced he could see shapes staring back.

*"The stories,"* Elric said suddenly. *"About goblin rituals. You believe any of it?"*

*"Meant to scare children."* Varian kept his voice light.

*"Captain takes them seriously."*

*"He has to."*

*"But you don't?"*

For a long moment Varian didn't answer. Then: *"I believe something lives in that forest that doesn't think the way we do. Maybe the goblins serve it. Maybe it uses them. Either way, only a fool goes looking."*

Elric grunted—and froze. *"There."* His torch jabbed toward the treeline. *"You see that?"*

Varian squinted. The torchlight barely cut the darkness. A pale circle swallowed by shadow.

*"I don't—wait."* Movement. A flicker, there and gone.

His blade slid free. They stood frozen, barely breathing, while the night pressed close around them.

A branch cracked.

Varian spun. A shape burst from the trees, racing toward the wall. Elric shouted and lunged, torch sweeping down—

A rabbit. A terrified rabbit that scampered between the posts and vanished into the underbrush.

Elric sagged against the wall, laughing shakily. *"Found our goblin."*

Varian didn't smile. He stood there staring into the forest while the night breeze raised the hair on his arms. When he sheathed his sword, his hands weren't steady.

## Uneasy Rest

Back to the barracks they stumbled, stiff with cold and bone-deep weariness.

Outside the long, low building, Elric paused. *"The things we heard as boys, Varian..."*

*"I know."* He gripped his friend's shoulder, felt the tension knotted there. *"Get some rest. Tomorrow comes whether we're ready or not."*

Rest proved elusive. Varian tossed on his narrow bed while shadows crawled across the ceiling. The girl's face swam behind his eyes. The old trees. Their branches reaching like fingers.

When sleep finally dragged him under, it was full of looming shapes and glinting eyes and the thick copper stench of blood.

## Dawn Brings Dread

Grey dawn. Grey sky.

Varian rose with his body aching and exhaustion sitting on his shoulders like a physical weight. He choked down watery porridge and walked out to the yard, where Elric waited with a face drawn and haggard.

*"Patrol's back."* No greeting. Just those three words, flat and grim. *"They found tracks."*

His stomach clenched. *"Show me."*

Through the outpost gate and toward the treeline. A knot of men stood in tense silence. They parted as Varian approached. In the damp earth at their feet: tracks, long and splayed, unmistakably inhuman.

Elric crouched, tracing one with his finger. *"Half a mile along the border. Scouting party, from the look of it."*

Varian didn't need to ask what kind. He stared into the forest—into those dark spaces between the trunks where anything might be watching—and felt cold settle in his chest.

*"They're testing us,"* he said quietly.

*"Then we'd best be ready."* Elric rose, his face hardening. He turned to the gathered men. *"Back to your posts. Sharpen your weapons, keep your eyes open. They won't catch us off guard."*

The men dispersed. Varian stayed where he was, gaze fixed on the shadows beneath those ancient trees. How long had they been out there—watching, waiting, testing?

He thought of the farmers who worked their fields within sight of that treeline. Brave fools, or blind ones. He'd never been able to decide.

*"Old gods protect us,"* he breathed.

Elric's hand landed on his shoulder, the grip fierce. *"Then we stand against whatever comes."*

They walked back through the gate together.

Neither looked back.
