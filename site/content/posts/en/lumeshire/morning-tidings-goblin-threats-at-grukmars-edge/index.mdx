##  | Goblin Threats at Grukmar's Edge

--- 

Mud sucked at Varian's boots as he climbed the path to the outpost, Elric close behind. His thumb traced the sword pommel at his hip—a nervous habit he'd never been able to break. That girl's face wouldn't leave him alone, her terror-wide eyes following him through the grey morning like a ghost he couldn't shake.

*"Sleep at all?"* Elric mumbled.

*"No. You?"*

*"Same."*

Neither spoke after that. What was there to say? Beyond them rose the outpost's wooden walls, little more than a fortified camp really, though it had held the border for decades. They passed through the gate with nods to bleary-eyed sentries, stepping around soldiers who milled about their tents with the aimless shuffle of men who sensed trouble coming but didn't yet know its shape.

Alden was waiting outside the captain's quarters. He leaned on his spear like it was the only thing holding him upright, and his young face had gone pale beneath the stubble.

*"What's happened?"* Varian asked.

*"Riders. From the frontier villages."*

*"Goblins?"* Elric's voice cracked on the word.

Alden just shrugged. *"They're inside with the captain. That's all I know."*

## The Captain's Orders

Varian rapped once on the weathered door and pushed it open without waiting for an answer. Inside, Captain Aldric stood behind his desk while two men in mud-spattered cloaks faced him, their shoulders hunched with exhaustion.

*"...found three more dead cows,"* one was saying. *"Throats cut."*

Aldric glanced up, his face grave. *"Varian. Elric."* He waved them forward.

*"Goblins?"* The word hung in the air, suddenly too loud in the cramped room.

*"It seems so."* Aldric stroked his bearded chin, lines of worry etched deep. *"These men found goblin tracks near the bodies. But no sightings."*

*"They killed three cows?"* Elric asked, brow furrowed.

*"Yes,"* the cloaked man said, voice rough with exhaustion. *"But they didn't take them."*

Silence held between them, uncomfortable and thick. The girl's scream echoed in Varian's memory—that animal terror. He cleared his throat.

*"Sir, we had an incident in the village last night. A girl, attacked near the square."* He told them about her terror, how she'd clawed at empty air, how no attacker was ever found. With each word, Aldric's face grew more somber.

*"No tracks? No signs at all?"*

*"None, sir. But she kept staring at the forest. Couldn't look away from it."*

Aldric dismissed the cloaked men with a nod and turned to face Varian and Elric. He paused, and Varian saw how heavily the years sat on those broad shoulders.

*"I'll be honest with you both."* His voice dropped. *"This is bad. But panic will get us killed faster than any goblin. We move methodically."*

*"What do we do?"* Elric asked.

The captain straightened, his voice taking on a familiar note of command. *"Double the watch. Patrol in pairs, never alone. I want a full search of our borders."*

*"We'll need more men,"* Varian said, mind racing through the implications. *"The outpost is already short-handed."*

*"I know. I'll fetch some in the village. Elric, see to that."* Aldric fixed them with a stern gaze. *"But listen well - no one goes into [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) territory. Understood? We watch, we guard. Nothing more."*

*"Yes sir."* The words tasted bitter in Varian's mouth. [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/) territory. The very thought made his skin crawl. 

## Preparations

*"I know."* Varian gripped his sword hilt, taking what comfort he could from the weight.

They spent the next hour walking the outpost border, checking the wall for weak spots and finding too many. Logs and rope and hope-that's all it was, really, standing against that vast dark forest to the north. Every time Varian glanced up, his eyes went straight to those trees, searching the shadows for a threat he couldn't name.

By midmorning they'd gathered a dozen men. Sleepy villagers, most of them, clutching spears and axes with white-knuckled grips. Some looked barely old enough to shave. All of them looked terrified, and Varian couldn't blame them.

*"Right."* His mouth had gone dry. *"You know why you're here."* Blank faces. He swallowed and pushed on. *"There's been trouble on the frontier. Attacks. The captain needs extra hands."*

Whispers rippled through the group. He raised his voice, forcing confidence into words that felt hollow. *"Four-hour shifts. An experienced guard with you at all times. Eyes open, wits sharp."* He paused. *"Questions?"*

Nobody spoke. He hadn't expected them to. *"Good. Elric will assign posts."*

## The Waiting

Elric's soft instructions faded behind him as he walked away. The sun climbed higher—a cold eye peeking through scudding clouds—and Varian paced the village edge until his legs ached, every shadow suspect, every rustle of leaves a threat that never materialized.

The day crawled. By dusk he found Elric in the armory, running a whetstone along his blade with slow, methodical strokes.

*"Quiet?"*

*"So far."* Elric didn't look up. *"You?"*

*"Same. Feels wrong, though. Like waiting for a storm you can smell but can't see."*

The whetstone paused. Elric tested the edge against his thumb, nodded, resumed. *"Captain's orders were clear."*

*"I know what the orders were."* Varian couldn't keep the edge from his voice. *"But if there are goblins out there—"*

*"What? You want to go hunting in [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)?"* Elric met his eyes. *"We don't cross that line. You know that."*

*"And when they cross it first?"*

A long pause. When Elric spoke again, his voice was quiet but steady. *"Then we'll be ready."*

## Night Watch

First watch they took together, walking the wall as the sun bled red and gold across the horizon. The forest lay utterly still. No wind. No birdsong. Nothing but the creak of their boots on old wood and the hammering of their own hearts. Every snapping twig sent hands flying to hilts.

True dark came, and with it the torches. Varian stared into the gloom beyond their flickering light, half-convinced he could see eyes staring back.

*"The stories,"* Elric said suddenly. *"About goblin rituals. You believe any of it?"*

*"Fireside tales."* Varian kept his voice light. *"Meant to scare children."*

*"Captain takes them seriously."*

*"He has to."*

*"But you don't?"*

For a long moment Varian didn't answer. Then: *"I believe an evil presence lives in that forest. Maybe the goblins serve it. Maybe it uses them. Either way, only a fool goes looking."*

Elric grunted—and froze. *"There."* His torch jabbed toward the treeline. *"You see that?"*

Varian squinted. The torchlight barely cut the darkness, a pale circle swallowed by shadow.

*"I don't—wait."* Movement. A flicker, there and gone.

His blade slid free of leather. They stood frozen, barely breathing, while the night pressed close around them. Then—a branch cracked like a thunderclap.

Varian spun. A shape burst from the trees, racing toward the wall. Elric shouted and lunged, torch sweeping down—

A rabbit. A terrified rabbit that scampered between the posts and vanished into the underbrush.

Elric sagged against the wall, laughing shakily. *"Found our goblin."*

Varian didn't smile. He stood there staring into the forest while the night breeze raised gooseflesh on his arms, and when he sheathed his sword, his hands weren't quite steady.

## Uneasy Rest

Back to the barracks they stumbled, stiff with cold and bone-deep weariness. The outpost lay silent around them.

Outside the long, low building, Elric paused. *"The things we heard as boys, Varian..."*

*"I know."* He gripped his friend's shoulder, felt the tension knotted there. *"Get some rest. Tomorrow comes whether we're ready or not."*

Rest proved elusive. Varian tossed on his narrow bed while shadows crawled across the ceiling and the girl's tear-stained face swam behind his eyes. The old trees. Their branches reaching like fingers. When sleep dragged him under, it was full of looming shapes and glinting eyes and the thick copper stench of blood.

## Dawn Brings Dread

Grey dawn. Grey sky. Varian rose with his body aching and exhaustion sitting heavy on his shoulders like a physical weight. He choked down watery porridge and walked out to the yard, where Elric waited with a face drawn and haggard—a mirror of how Varian felt.

*"Patrol's back."* No greeting. Just those three words, flat and grim. *"They found tracks."*

His stomach clenched. *"Show me."*

Through the outpost gate and toward the treeline, where a knot of men stood in tense silence. They parted as Varian approached. In the damp earth at their feet: tracks, long and splayed, unmistakably inhuman.

Elric crouched, tracing one with his finger. *"Half a mile along the border. Scouting party, from the look of it."*

Varian didn't need to ask what kind of tracks. He stared into the forest—into those dark spaces between the trunks where anything might be watching—and felt cold settle in his chest.

*"They're coming,"* he said quietly. *"Gods help us. They're coming at last."*

*"Then we'd best be ready."* Elric rose, his face gone hard. He turned to the gathered men. *"Back to your posts. Sharpen your weapons, keep your eyes open. They won't catch us off guard."*

The men dispersed, muttering. Varian stayed where he was, rooted to the spot, gaze fixed on the shadows beneath those ancient trees. How long had they been out there—watching, waiting, testing? He thought of the farmers who worked their fields within sight of that treeline—brave fools, or blind ones, he'd never been able to decide.

*"Old gods protect us,"* he breathed. *"Wickedness is stirring in [Grukmar](https://www.drusniel.com/el-poder-indomito-de-las-tribus-grukmar/)."*

Elric's hand landed on his shoulder, the grip fierce. *"Then we stop it. Whatever crawls out of those trees—we stand against it."*

They walked back through the gate together, and neither looked back.
