1. filename: climb-to-outpost.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: grim focus, breath tight in the cold. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: irritated squint, jaw clenched. Varian climbs a steep, muddy hill toward the outpost while Elric follows one step behind, boots sinking and pulling strings of mud, rain-darkened cloaks heavy on their shoulders, palisade and watch platform looming above with a windless treeline beyond. Overcast daylight is the only light, flat grey and diffused, catching pale highlights on wet wood, slick stone, and churned mud. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: rider-report.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Two men in mud-spattered cloaks faced him")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: storm-ready restraint, eyes narrowed; hands planted on the desk. Two riders in mud-spattered cloaks report in low, exhausted voices, shoulders rounded like they've been carrying fear for miles, damp footprints and grit tracked across the floor, spear rack and rough timber walls closing in. A single lantern flame throws warm amber light upward, hard shadows behind the riders, and a thin sheen of reflection on wet cloth and wood. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: night-watch-silence.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "First watch they took together. The forest lay utterly still.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: fixed stare, fingers tight on the torch haft. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: tense alertness, shoulders braced. Varian and Elric stand on the outpost wall during first watch, boots creaking on wet planks as they look out at a wall of black trees and unbroken stillness with no wind and no birdsong. Cold moonlight provides a thin rim light while their torch casts wavering orange across wood grain and the edge of half-drawn steel. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: rabbit-scare.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A rabbit. A terrified rabbit that scampered between the posts")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: sudden shock, blade halfway out. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: startled anger turning to relief. A rabbit bursts from the treeline and darts between the posts in a smear of motion, torchlight strobing across wet planks as both men jerk into action and then freeze, realizing the false alarm. Torchlight patches are the primary illumination, warm and flickering, with cold moonlight filling shadows to blue-grey. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: inhuman-prints.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "In the damp earth: prints, long and splayed, unmistakably inhuman.")
prompt:Long, splayed inhuman footprints press deep into damp earth at grey dawn, water beads clinging to the edges, pine needles and crushed grass framing the mark, ridges crisp and wet. Low dawn light is the only illumination, cold and diffuse, grazing across wet mud to spark tiny highlights while the surrounding ground falls to flat shadow. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
