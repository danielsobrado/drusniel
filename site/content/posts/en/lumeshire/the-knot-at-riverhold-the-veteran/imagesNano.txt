1. filename: Eldric-tavern-exits.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: bitter restraint, eyes tracking. Shoulders angled to move, hand near a cheap tankard. Sitting alone in a dim tavern corner, three exits framed in the background (front door, curtained back passage by the kitchen, narrow stairwell rising into shadow) as passing patrons smear into motion blur through smoky air; rough wood table grain, spilled ale sheen, soot-dark corners. Only light: hearth fire to camera-left and a single candle sconce behind him; orange firelight casts interactive highlights across wet glass and varnished wood, smoke scattering the light into haze, candle adds a thin rim on cheekbone while the far room falls into near-black. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: sera-arrives.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A woman stood at his table—middle-aged, travel-worn")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sera]. Expression: exhausted urgency, dust clinging to collar edge. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: guarded appraisal, looking up without surprise. Sera stands at Eldric’s small tavern table with the empty chair between them untouched, hanging smoke and background drinkers dissolving into bokeh while the tension at the table stays crisp; scuffed travel fabric, damp boot prints on worn floorboards. Cool window daylight backlights Sera’s shoulders, while warm hearth firelight fills both faces from below; amber reflections slide across the tankard and catch pores and knuckle ridges, with colder blue-grey spill from the window outlining cloak edges. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: riverhold-streets-alert.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The streets of Riverhold were crowded with the usual chaos")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: tense focus, eyes scanning hard. [Face_Reference: Sera]. Expression: breathless determination, watching him for cues. Eldric threads through a crowded Riverhold street of carts, shouted bargains, and muddy footprints, slipping between shoulders and harnesses like a man expecting violence; the crowd smears into motion blur while he stays sharp in the center. Overcast daylight is the primary light source, soft grey fill with a pale rim of sun breaking through cloud; wet cobbles and cloak hems catch dull specular highlights that bounce faintly onto lower faces, shadows staying cool and flat. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, motion blur in the crowd, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: scholars-rest-room.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Eldric found Xandor in a private room on the second floor")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: startled warmth turning to concern, ink-stained fingers paused. In a cramped private room above the Scholar’s Rest, stacks of worn bindings, rolled maps, and loose papers pinned by stones spill across desk and floor (writing indistinct), while Eldric and Sera linger as soft shapes near the doorway. A small oil lamp on the desk throws amber uplight onto Xandor’s face and hands; cold window daylight cuts in from the side, lighting dust motes and catching the microtexture of parchment fibers and cracked leather spines, with amber reflections pooling in the lamp oil’s glass. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus foreground, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: changes-everything.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "What they're carrying changes everything.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression delta: tired bitterness tightening into sharpened purpose, eyes narrowing, jaw setting. Seated in Xandor’s cramped room with paper stacks and map edges blurred behind, Eldric absorbs the sentence that changes the day; stillness heavier than motion, breath held. Desk-lamp amber light rakes up from below across one side of his face, warm highlights catching pores and the edge of his lower eyelid; cool window light outlines the far cheek in a thin rim, background dropping into soft shadow. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
