1. filename: Eldric-tavern-exits.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, bitter exhaustion held behind alert eyes; jaw set, shoulders angled as if ready to move. He sits alone in a dim tavern corner, cheap ale sweating on the table, silently clocking three exits: the front door, a curtained back passage by the kitchen, and a narrow stairwell rising into shadow; patrons blur past in soft motion while he stays razor-sharp. Warm orange firelight from a hearth to camera-left and a single candle sconce behind him, the light catching the rim of his cheek and glinting in the glass while the far corners fall into smoke-dark. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed corners. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: sera-arrives.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A woman stood at his table—middle-aged, travel-worn")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sera] Photorealistic, travel-worn fatigue with urgency in her gaze; dust clinging to her collar and cloak edges. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Looking up without surprise, expression guarded and appraising, hand still near his tankard. Sera stands at Eldric's small table in the crowded tavern as if she has walked straight through the room to him, the empty chair between them untouched; background figures and hanging smoke soften into bokeh while the tension at the table stays crisp. Cool daylight from a grimy window backlights Sera’s shoulders, while warm firelight from the hearth fills their faces from below, leaving thin, uneasy shadows under brows. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: riverhold-streets-alert.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The streets of Riverhold were crowded with the usual chaos")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, tense focus; eyes flicking left and right, mouth held thin, pace measured but urgent. [Face_Reference: Sera] Close behind him, breathing hard, watching him for cues. Eldric threads through a crowded Riverhold street packed with carts, shouted bargains, and muddy footprints, slipping between shoulders and harnesses like a man used to crowds that turn violent; the mass of townsfolk smears into motion blur while he stays in crisp focus. Flat overcast daylight with a pale rim of sun breaking through cloud, catching damp cobbles and the wet edges of cloaks in cold highlights. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, slight motion blur in the crowd, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: scholars-rest-room.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Eldric found Xandor in a private room on the second floor")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, startled warmth flickering into concern as he looks up from his work; ink-stained fingers paused mid-page. The private upstairs room is cramped with stacked books, rolled maps, and loose papers pinned by stones, a scholar’s chaos spilling across the desk and floor; Eldric and Sera linger near the doorway as shapes in the foreground while Xandor becomes the room’s still center. A small oil lamp on the desk throws amber light upward onto Xandor’s face, while cold window daylight cuts in from the side, illuminating dust motes and catching the worn textures of bindings and parchment (any writing indistinct). Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus foreground, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: changes-everything.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "What they're carrying changes everything.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, expression shifting in a single breath from tired bitterness to sharpened purpose; eyes narrowing, jaw tightening as if a plan clicks into place. Seated in Xandor’s cramped room with paper stacks and map edges blurred behind him, Eldric absorbs the sentence that changes the shape of the day; his stillness feels heavier than motion. Desk-lamp amber light rakes across one side of his face from below, while cool window light outlines the far cheek in a thin rim, leaving the background to fall into soft shadow. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
