## Chapter 16 | Part 3

--- 

The argument began at dawn.

Eldric spread the map across the table, his finger tracing two lines north. "Fast route. Three days. Mountain passes, exposed terrain, but we move quickly."

"And walk straight through Grukmar patrol territory," Dulint countered. "We've seen the signs. They're organized. They're hunting."

"They're always hunting. Speed gets us through before they can react."

"Speed gets us killed."

The others watched the exchange silently. Xandor, neutral as always. Balin, clearly itching to move. Maris, pale and quiet, the Beacon's constant presence wearing on her.

"The longer route." Dulint pointed to a different line. "Six days. Valley paths, more cover. Harder terrain, but safer."

"Three extra days." Eldric's voice was flat. "Three days where the artifact keeps broadcasting. Three days where whatever's tracking us gets closer."

He wasn't wrong. Dulint knew he wasn't wrong. The logic was sound—speed minimized exposure, reduced the window of vulnerability.

But the seer's voice echoed in his mind. *Slowly. Fail slowly, and some may survive.*

"The Grukmar in those mountains aren't scouts," Dulint said. "They're ambush teams. Organized, experienced. We walk the fast route, we're betting everything on getting through before they find us."

"And the slow route?"

"We take longer, but we control the engagement if one happens. Cover, sight lines, terrain advantage."

Xandor spoke finally. "Both positions have merit. The question is which risk we prefer—speed with exposure, or caution with time."

"The artifact's broadcast doesn't care about our preferences," Eldric said. "Every day we delay is another day something finds us."

Dulint looked at Balin. His nephew's face was eager, wanting to move, wanting to act. The same impulsiveness that made him brave could get him killed.

"We take the slow route," Dulint said. "Safety over speed."

Eldric's jaw tightened, but he didn't argue further. The decision was made.

Three days. It sounded like nothing. Dulint knew it would mean everything.
