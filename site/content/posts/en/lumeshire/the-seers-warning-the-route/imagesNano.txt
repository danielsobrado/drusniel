1. filename: eldric-traces-lines.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint, Balin, Xandor, Maris]. Tense dawn debate; Eldric leans over the map with a gloved finger tracing the fast route, Dulint holds a skeptical stare across the table, the others watch in silence with restrained reactions. Inn common room turned planning table: worn map on scratched wood, candle stubs and travel gear pushed aside, mugs gone cold, packs stacked near the wall. Warm dawn light from a side window rakes across the paper fibers and wood grain, creating hard directional highlights on map creases; a weak ember flicker from the hearth adds low orange movement that paints interactive warm highlights under hands and turns the shadow edges to soft amber. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: grukmar-patrol-sign.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "We've seen the signs. They're organized. They're hunting.")
prompt:Ominous forest detail; a crude Grukmar totem and claw-scratched territory mark hang from a dead branch, damp bark dark with cold moisture, ash grit caught in crevices, a faint smoke plume far beyond the treeline. Layered grey trunks and undergrowth fall into the background, the path barely suggested. Flat overcast daylight turns the sky into a cold softbox, pulling crisp texture from wet wood fibers and rope; moisture creates thin specular highlights on bark ridges while the underside shadows remain dense and cool. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dulint-remembers-seer.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "But the seer's voice echoed in his mind. Slowly.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Burdened focus; he pauses beside the table, eyes closing for a beat, then opens them with a decision hardening, as if the word will not stop echoing. His face reflects in a shallow basin of water with slight ripple distortion, background figures blurred into soft shapes. Cold dawn spill from the window sharpens the reflection edge and turns the water surface into a thin mirror, while faint ember and candle remnants add warm amber highlights that wobble across the ripples and reflect as tiny moving points in the eyes. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: balin-eager.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "His nephew's face was eager, wanting to move, wanting to act.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Controlled impatience; eager eyes, shoulders pitched forward, tightening a strap with one hand while the other hovers near a weapon grip. He stands near the doorway where cold air leaks in and makes his breath faintly visible, scuffed gear catching morning. Bright cool daylight from outside the door gives clean illumination and sharp edge highlights on straps and knuckles; the darker room behind falls into warm ember-shadow, creating a natural color contrast with soft falloff and slight halation on the brightest edges. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: dulint-makes-decision.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "We take the slow route, Dulint said. Safety over speed.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Eldric, Balin, Xandor, Maris]. Decision that costs time; Dulint anchors the foreground pointing firmly to the valley line on the map, Eldric faces him with restrained frustration, Balin disappointed, Xandor neutral and measuring, Maris pale and quiet. The table becomes a battlefield of hands and glances, map creased and worn, packs stacked for immediate departure. Clear morning light from the window rakes across faces and paper, creating interactive highlights on map folds and knuckle edges; weak ember flicker adds warm movement in shadow pockets under hands and along the table edge. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in pointing hand, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
