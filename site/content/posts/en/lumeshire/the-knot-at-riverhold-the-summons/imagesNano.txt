1. filename: meeting-the-dwarves.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: guarded calculation, eyes scanning before they settle on the table. [Face_Reference: Dulint]. Expression: bone-tired calm, hands steady. [Face_Reference: Balin]. Expression: restless impatience, weight shifting. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: careful intensity, keeping distance. Eldric stands in the doorway of a cramped room at the Scholar’s Rest as Xandor presents the Beacon on pale silk at the table’s center, dark metal cut with nonlinguistic geometric channels and one face subtly brighter as if oriented; candle stubs, wax drips, and heavy shadows crowd the corners and the rain-dark window. Flickering candles cast warm amber that reflects off varnished wood and wet eyes; the Beacon’s cold blue-white internal glow adds icy fill from below, blue highlights catching undersides of jawlines and knuckles, halation blooming in the smoke-haze. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: cube-on-silk.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A cube. Perhaps four inches on each side")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of the Beacon: a dark metal cube resting on pale silk, the weave sharply visible where the weight bites into folds. Surface is unfamiliar alloy with fine geometric grooves and inlaid seams (no letters), one face subtly more luminous as if oriented; cold blue-white glow trapped inside metal. Mixed candlelight plus internal glow: warm amber reflections ripple across silk fibers while icy edge highlights trace the cube’s corners; shadows around the base deepen as if light falloff steepens near it. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: balin-impatience.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The younger dwarf—Balin, Eldric assumed—made a frustrated noise.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]. Expression: frustration breaking through restraint, brows drawn down, jaw tight. Rising from his chair by the window and leaning toward the table, one hand mid-gesture as he demands answers while the older men stay still; the Beacon glows between them on silk. Candlelight flicker from a wall sconce to camera-right casts warm orange patches on sleeves and beard edges; the Beacon’s cold spill lifts the underside of his hands and chin in icy highlights, with motion blur streaking only the gesturing hand. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, motion blur, film grain visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: xandor-explains.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The Nexus references, the barrier mechanics")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor]. Expression: intense focus, mouth tight with careful words; hands hovering close, mapping a boundary without touching. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: clinical attention, still as stone. Xandor leans over the table and frames the Beacon above the silk, rough diagrams and scattered papers around it (writing indistinct), wax drips frozen on candleholders, the room cramped with pressure. The Beacon’s cold blue-white glow provides uneasy uplight across knuckles and cheekbones; a candle behind adds warm rim light that separates faces from pooled shadow, reflections sliding across lamp-black ink stains on fingers. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: counting-exits.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric counted exits. Three in this room.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: paranoia made practical, attention split. Over his shoulder from just inside the doorway, composition forces the exits to dominate: door latch in crisp focus, window frame with rain-dark street beyond, curtained back passage near the kitchen; table with Beacon and the others soften into blur as if his mind refuses to stop mapping routes. Warm candle pools near the table, but colder window light outlines damp wood and glass edges; cold reflections on the wet sill pull the eye toward escape while blue Beacon spill ghosts across the floorboards. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
