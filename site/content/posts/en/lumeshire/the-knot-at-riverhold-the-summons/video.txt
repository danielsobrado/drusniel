## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The Beacon gives off a slow pulse, dust motes brightening as the blue-white glow thickens; Xandor’s hovering hands twitch back as if a pressure wave passes.
[00:03-00:05] Candle flames bend and stutter, throwing moving shadows across the table; Eldric’s fingers tighten on the wood as his eyes track the cube’s orientation.
[00:05-00:08] The luminous face rotates a few degrees as if it has found a new line, and both men freeze as soft footsteps start on the stairs outside the room.

Slow dolly-in from the Beacon up to Xandor and Eldric’s faces.
Audio: candle hiss and crackle, wax drip, faint electrical hum from the artifact, cloth rustle, floorboard creak, distant footsteps on stairs, held breath. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
