## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A cold draft slides across the table; paper corners lift and settle. Faelyn's fingertip hesitates. Dust motes drift through the window light.
[00:03-00:05] The forest border ink line on the newest map creeps a few millimeters under her fingertip, as if tugged from below. A wax-tag thread tightens, then relaxes.
[00:05-00:08] The ink line shudders, splits into a faint double trace, then stills. The living-wood walls creak once, deep and close. Faelyn jerks her hand back.

Slow overhead push-in, tightening on the moving ink line.
Audio: paper rustle, faint leaf hiss behind the walls, soft creak of living wood, thread fibers squeaking under tension, a single dry tap as her fingertip pulls away. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
