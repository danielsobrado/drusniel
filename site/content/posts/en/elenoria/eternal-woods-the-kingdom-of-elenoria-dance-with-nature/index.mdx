The archive keeper's hands trembled as she turned the page.

Faelyn had been searching the Aelindril libraries for three months. The texts she sought were old—older than the current dynasty, older than the wars with Lumeshire, older perhaps than the city itself. If they still existed at all.

"You're looking in the wrong section."

She didn't turn. The voice belonged to Thandril, the senior archivist, whose footsteps she'd learned to recognize by their particular silence.

"The histories of the First Age are catalogued here," she said.

"The *approved* histories are catalogued there." Thandril appeared beside her, his fingers tracing the spine of a leather-bound tome. "What you're looking for—assuming it exists—would be in the restricted collection. Behind the third seal."

"I don't have access to the third seal."

"No. You don't."

The silence between them stretched. Outside, sunlight filtered through living branches that formed the library's walls. Everything in Aelindril grew. The buildings, the bridges, the archives themselves. The elves claimed it was harmony. Faelyn had begun to suspect it was something else.

"Why do you want to know about the border wards?" Thandril asked finally. "The official position is clear. They've held for two thousand years. They will hold for two thousand more."

"The rangers reported anomalies last season."

"Rangers always report anomalies. It's in their nature to see threats."

"Three patrols went into the eastern groves. Two returned." Faelyn closed the useless book in front of her. "The third was found a week later. Their equipment was intact. Their journals were intact. Their bodies were present and unharmed. But they were—"

"Empty. Yes. I read the report." Thandril's expression didn't change. "The Council attributed it to grove sickness. A known condition affecting those who wander too deep."

"There's no mention of grove sickness in any text I can access."

"The condition is rare. The references are... carefully preserved."

Carefully hidden, she thought. But she didn't say it.

> *"It is said that in the dawn of the world, the elves were already there, their eyes shining with the light of the divine and their hearts filled with the song of the universe."*

The words came from the oldest hymn, sung at every festival, taught to every child. Faelyn had believed them once. She still wanted to believe them.

But the archives told a different story—or rather, they told no story at all. Gaps in the records. Missing centuries. Cross-references that led to empty shelves. The history of Elenoria was old, yes. But it was also incomplete. Curated. Shaped.

She returned to her assigned work: transcribing trade agreements with the southern realms. Safe texts. Approved texts. The kind that wouldn't raise questions.

But at night, when the library was empty and the living walls breathed in their slow, patient rhythm, she sometimes heard whispers from the restricted sections. Sounds that might have been the wood settling. Might have been something else.

The senior archivists never worked after dark.

Faelyn was beginning to understand why.

Three weeks later, another patrol reported movement in the eastern groves. Not an attack—nothing so clear. Just... movement. Trees that seemed to have shifted position. Paths that no longer matched the maps.

The Council convened. Faelyn wasn't invited, but she heard the outcome: the maps would be redrawn. The patrols would be reassigned to different routes. The matter was closed.

She filed the updated cartography in the appropriate section and noticed, not for the first time, how many previous maps had been marked *superseded* over the centuries. Dozens of them. Hundreds. Each one showing borders that had contracted slightly, forests that had grown or shifted or simply changed.

The official position remained unchanged: Elenoria endured. The ancient forests stood. The crystal streams flowed.

But somewhere in the restricted archive, behind the third seal that Faelyn couldn't access, there were texts that told a different story. She was certain of it.

She would probably never read them.

Some knowledge, she was learning, was kept not because it was sacred, but because it was dangerous.

The library walls breathed. The branches grew. And in the eastern groves, something continued to move in ways that didn't match the maps.
