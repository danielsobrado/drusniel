1. filename: oracle-overlooks-ruined-keeps.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Quiet authority; one hand rubbing the bridge of his nose; the other resting on a lectern edge. An older male sage stands at the front of a stone lecture hall, faded elemental diagram chalked on a blackboard behind him; rows of student desks recede into shadow; ink bottles, a leather pouch, and three dull pebbles sit on the lectern beside a single unlit candle. Overcast daylight from high narrow windows provides cool even illumination across stone and wood; warm amber from a wall-mounted oil lamp catches chalk dust in the air and edges the sage's robe in gold. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, deep depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: sage-confronts-threat.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The flame burned blue.")
prompt:Extreme close-up of a candle on a stone lectern: the wick burns with a vivid blue flame instead of normal amber, casting cold blue highlights across three dull pebbles and the edge of a leather pouch nearby; a hand enters the frame from the right, fingers closing to pinch the wick dead. The blue flame is the primary diegetic light, washing the immediate area in an unnatural cold tone while warm amber from distant oil lamps barely reaches the lectern. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Ektar 100, razor-thin focal plane, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: sage-moves-through-storm-plains.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He set it back down with the others and wiped his palm against his robe.")
prompt:Close-up of a calloused hand cradling a single dull pebble: the stone appears unremarkable except for a faint warmth visible as a barely perceptible glow where skin meets stone; behind, two other inert pebbles sit on a worn oak lectern beside a leather pouch and an extinguished candle. A distant oil lamp provides weak warm backfill that catches the texture of the sage's robe sleeve; the pebble's subtle warmth casts no shadows but adds an almost imperceptible amber highlight to the fingertips. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Ektar 100, razor-thin focal plane, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: ignimancy-clue-discovery.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "He glanced at his right palm. Flexed it once, as if checking. Then continued.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Brow furrowed; eyes cast down toward his own open right hand; expression: quiet unease masked by composure. The sage stands at a lectern in a stone lecture hall, palm open as if inspecting it for something invisible; behind him, the blackboard shows a faded elemental diagram and rows of student faces are soft and out of focus. A single oil lamp provides warm amber sidelight that catches the lines and calluses of the open palm; the rest of the hall falls into cool blue-grey shadow from the high windows. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field focused on the hand. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: miragery-consequence-realized.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "She did.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Standing at the lectern gathering notes; expression: guarded finality; gaze directed at someone out of frame. The sage holds a stack of papers against his chest with one hand while the other rests near the leather pouch containing the stones; behind him, student desks are visible with one student in soft focus closing a notebook. Warm amber from the oil lamp provides key light on the sage's face and catches the paper edges; cool window light fills the rest of the hall in muted grey. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
