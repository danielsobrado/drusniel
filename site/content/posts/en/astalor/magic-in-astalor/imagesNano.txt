1. filename: oracle-overlooks-ruined-keeps.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage]. Quiet authority; one hand rubbing the bridge of his nose; the other resting on a lectern edge. An older male sage at the front of a stone lecture hall; faded elemental diagram chalked on a blackboard behind him; rows of student desks recede into shadow; ink bottles, a leather pouch, and three dull pebbles on the lectern beside a single unlit candle.
Environment: Overcast daylight from high narrow windows provides cool even illumination across stone and wood. Warm amber from a wall-mounted oil lamp catches chalk dust and edges the sage's robe in gold; deep shadows pool in corners and under desks.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, deep depth of field. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: sage-confronts-threat.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The flame burned blue.")
prompt:Extreme close-up of a candle on a stone lectern: the wick burns with a vivid blue flame instead of normal amber, casting cold blue highlights across three dull pebbles and the edge of a leather pouch; a hand enters the frame from the right, fingers closing to pinch the wick dead.
Environment: The blue flame is the primary diegetic light, washing the immediate area in unnatural cold tone. Warm amber from distant oil lamps barely reaches the lectern; blue highlights scatter across stone surface and polished pebble edges.
Camera: Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, razor-thin focal plane, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: sage-moves-through-storm-plains.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He set it back down with the others and wiped his palm against his robe.")
prompt:Close-up of a calloused hand cradling a single dull pebble: the stone appears unremarkable except for a faint warmth visible as barely perceptible glow where skin meets stone; behind, two other inert pebbles on a worn oak lectern beside a leather pouch and an extinguished candle.
Environment: A distant oil lamp provides weak warm backfill catching the texture of the sage's robe sleeve. The pebble's subtle warmth adds an almost imperceptible amber highlight to the fingertips; shadow pools between fingers and in the stone's surface texture.
Camera: Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, razor-thin focal plane, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: ignimancy-clue-discovery.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "He glanced at his right palm. Flexed it once, as if checking. Then continued.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage]. Brow furrowed; eyes cast down toward his own open right hand; expression: quiet unease masked by composure. Standing at a lectern in a stone lecture hall, palm open as if inspecting it for something invisible; blackboard with faded elemental diagram behind him; rows of student faces soft and out of focus.
Environment: A single oil lamp provides warm amber sidelight catching the lines and calluses of the open palm. The rest of the hall falls into cool blue-grey shadow from high windows; the diagram chalk dust catches a faint backlit edge.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field focused on the hand. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: miragery-consequence-realized.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "She did.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage]. Standing at the lectern gathering notes; expression: guarded finality; gaze directed at someone out of frame. Holding papers against his chest with one hand while the other rests near the leather pouch; student desks behind with one student in soft focus closing a notebook.
Environment: Warm amber from the oil lamp provides key light on the sage's face and catches paper edges. Cool window light fills the rest of the hall in muted grey; long shadows from the lectern stretch across the stone floor.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
