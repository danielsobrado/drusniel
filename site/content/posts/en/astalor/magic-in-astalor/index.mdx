## Lore | Magic in Astalor

--- 

Magic is rare, and those who carry it pay for the privilege. **Mages** walk a precarious path, wielding power that's as dangerous as it is wondrous.

## The Elemental Foundations

At the heart of magic lie four elements: **water, fire, earth**, and **air**. Each mage masters one. Some grasp a related element. But opposites remain forever out of reach. No mage commands both **water and fire**, or **earth and air**. The elements will not share a vessel with their enemy.

## The Art of Spellcasting

Casting a spell demands utmost concentration, precise timing, and perfect intonation.

> "Casting a spell is no simple feat. Mages must concentrate their minds, drawing intricate magical runes in their thoughts while uttering the incantations with precise timing and intonation. Even the slightest mistake can have disastrous consequences, making the practice of magic a high-risk endeavor."

One misstep can spell disaster. Magic is unforgiving. It rewards precision and punishes carelessness.

## Nature's Role in Magic

Words and thoughts alone don't make a spell. Physical components matter. **Herbs and extracts** enhance. But **stones**? They're the true key. They unlock a mage's full potential.

Yet these stones are rare—precious and fleeting.

> "However, they are not easy to come by. The unworked stones must be closely examined, and only a precious few contain the power needed to cast spells. Once a suitable stone is found, it can only be used once before its power is exhausted, crumbling into dust or shattering into useless fragments."

Use a stone, and it's gone. Turned to dust or useless shards. This scarcity shapes Astalor's arcane map. Some regions overflow with certain magics. In others, they're mere myths. Mage guilds rise, vying for control of valuable deposits.

## Divine Favor and Magic

There's another path to power: the **favor of the gods**. Through devotion and prayer, mages can amplify their magic. But gods are fickle. Demanding. The rewards are great, but so are the risks.

## The Price of Power

As mages grow, casting becomes easier. More powerful. But the cost never truly fades. Overuse leads to exhaustion. Insanity. Even death. And magic attracts attention - from rivals, supernatural entities, or those who fear its power.

## The Eight Schools

Magic in Astalor isn't a cure-all. It's a tool: elusive, demanding. Eight schools exist, each with its own strengths and challenges:

1. **Hydromancy** (Water): The art of flowing and adapting. Includes healing, purification, and manipulation of liquids.
2. **Ignimancy** (Fire): The discipline of passion and transformation. Covers combat magic, energy manipulation, and purification through flame.
3. **Geomancy** (Earth): The study of stability and growth. Encompasses protection magic, physical enhancement, and manipulation of stone and plant life.
4. **Ventomancy** (Air): The practice of freedom and intellect. Involves weather control, enhancing speed, and manipulating gases.
5. **Necromancy**: The controversial art of life, death, and undeath. Focuses on communicating with spirits, manipulating life force, and reanimation.
6. **Omencraft**: The discipline of unveiling hidden truths. Covers scrying, prophecy, and gleaning knowledge from otherworldly sources.
7. **Evocation**: The practice of calling forth the unseen. Involves summoning entities, creating objects from magical energy, and teleportation.
8. **Miragery**: The art of bending reality. Encompasses creating false sensory experiences, manipulating perceptions, and veiling the truth.

Each path carries its own rewards and its own costs. The choice shapes the mage as much as the mage shapes the magic.

In Astalor, magic is never taken lightly. Those who wield it learn quickly that the power answers to no one.
