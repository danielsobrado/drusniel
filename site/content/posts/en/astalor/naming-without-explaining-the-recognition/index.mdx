# Chapter 14.1 | The Recognition

Xandor had studied fragments for forty years.

Scattered texts. Partial translations. Half-burned manuscripts recovered from ruins across three kingdoms. He had spent his life piecing together hints of something vast—something that most scholars dismissed as myth or metaphor.

Now it sat on the table in front of him, and he was terrified.

The cube pulsed with that soft light, its symbols shifting in patterns he almost recognized. *Almost*. That was the problem. He could see the edges of understanding, could feel the shape of knowledge just beyond his grasp, but the full picture remained elusive.

"You've been staring at it for an hour." Dulint's voice came from across the room, patient but concerned. "What do you see?"

"I see something I've spent my whole life looking for." Xandor's hands trembled slightly as he reached toward the artifact. "And I realize I never truly believed I'd find it."

The cube—the *Beacon*, he corrected himself, because names mattered—warmed at his approach. Not unpleasantly. More like recognition. Like it knew what he was.

"The texts called it the Nexus," he said quietly. "I thought they were being poetic. A connection point. A hub. I didn't realize they were being literal."

"Nexus." Aldric tested the word from his position by the door. He hadn't relaxed since arriving, hadn't stopped watching the windows and exits. "What does that mean?"

"It means this isn't just an artifact. It's part of a system." Xandor finally touched the cube's surface, and something shivered through him—not painful, but vast. Like touching the edge of an ocean. "A system designed to connect things that shouldn't be connected. Places. Powers. Perhaps... realities."

Maris stirred from her corner. She'd been quiet since arriving, her seer's sensitivity clearly overwhelmed by the Beacon's presence. "It screams at me. Constantly. What is it screaming?"

"It's searching." Xandor pulled his hand back, steadying himself. "The Nexus system has multiple functions—multiple phases, the texts call them. What we're carrying is the first phase. Sense." He paused, organizing decades of fragmentary knowledge into something coherent. "It's designed to locate the other pieces. To find what's missing."

"Other pieces?" Balin leaned forward, young face intent. "There's more?"

"There must be. The texts mention five phases in total. We have one—the one that searches. The others are out there somewhere, waiting to be found." Xandor turned back to the Beacon. "Or waiting to find us."

The artifact pulsed again, and for just a moment, Xandor felt something he hadn't expected: recognition. Not from himself—from the Beacon. As if it knew what he was. What he'd been searching for.

*I found you,* something seemed to whisper. *After all this time.*

Or perhaps that was just an old scholar's wishful thinking.

"You can name it," Dulint said slowly. "But can you control it?"

Xandor looked at the Beacon—at decades of research finally given form—and felt the weight of everything he didn't know pressing down on him.

"No," he admitted. "I can name it. I can't control it. And naming without controlling is the most dangerous thing in the world."
