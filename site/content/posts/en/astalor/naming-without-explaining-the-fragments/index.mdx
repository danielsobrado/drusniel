# Chapter 14.3 | The Fragments

"Tell us what you know."

Aldric's voice was flat, demanding. A soldier's tone, expecting a report. Xandor found himself responding to it automatically, organizing his fragmentary knowledge into something resembling a briefing.

"The Nexus system has five phases. Five functions, five pieces, five stages of operation." He pulled one of his plants closer, using the table's surface to trace patterns as he spoke. "The texts name them: Sense, Erase, Alter, Bind, Rewrite."

"What do they mean?" Balin asked.

"Sense is what we have. It searches, locates, identifies. The Beacon." Xandor touched the artifact gently. "Erase—I believe that's a clearance function. Removing obstacles, perhaps. Or memories. The texts are unclear."

"Removing memories?" Maris's voice was sharp. "It can do that?"

"The complete system can. Supposedly. What each piece does individually..." He shook his head. "I don't know. I've spent forty years gathering fragments, and I still don't understand the whole."

"Continue," Aldric said.

"Alter comes next. Changing something—reality, perception, physical form. The texts describe it as 'the hand that shapes.' Then Bind, which connects things. Ties them together in ways that can't be broken." Xandor paused before the final word. "And Rewrite."

The room waited.

"Rewrite is the final function. The ultimate purpose." Xandor's voice dropped. "The texts describe it as the power to unmake and remake. To change what is into what could be. Or what was into what never happened."

"That's..." Balin trailed off, unable to find words.

"Impossible? Perhaps. But the system exists. We're holding part of it." Xandor looked at the Beacon. "What I don't know is what the Nexus is designed to rewrite. The barrier? Wyrmreach itself? Something larger?" He spread his hands. "The texts end in fire. Burned pages, destroyed libraries. Whoever knew the full truth made sure it wouldn't survive."

"This connects to everything," Dulint said slowly. "The barrier. Wyrmreach. The things that cross over."

"I believe so. The Nexus system is ancient—older than recorded history, according to some sources. It was built to interact with something fundamental. To change something at the deepest level."

"And now it's active," Aldric said. "Broadcasting."

"And incomplete. That may be the most dangerous part." Xandor met each of their eyes in turn. "A complete Nexus might be controllable. Might be understood. But what we have is a fragment searching for the rest of itself. And we have no idea what will happen when it finds them."

The Beacon pulsed, its symbols shifting in patterns that almost made sense. Sense. Erase. Alter. Bind. Rewrite.

Names without explanations. Power without understanding.

Xandor had spent his life seeking knowledge. Now he held it, and it wasn't enough.

"Rewrite." Maris spoke the word like a curse. "Whatever this system can do, it ends in something that changes everything."

No one disagreed.
