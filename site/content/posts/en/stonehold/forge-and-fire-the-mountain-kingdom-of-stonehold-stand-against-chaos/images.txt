1. filename: bragni-measures-crack.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Bragni] Expression: tight focus, worry held back; grip firm on the tape as if the number might change again. Foreman Bragni stands on an inspection ladder deep in a Stonehold shaft, pressing a measuring tape to a jagged crack in smooth blessed stone; the surrounding walls sweat geothermal warmth and taste of metal, but the fissure rim carries a cold sheen and damp condensation. Flickering torchlight from a wall bracket behind him provides hot amber light that makes iron dust sparkle in the air; the frost-cold moisture at the crack edge catches the same light as pale, almost blue highlights against warm stone. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: impassable-rock-chart.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The line marking Shaft Six ended in a solid black fill—the cartographic symbol for *impassable rock, confirmed by survey*.")
prompt:Top-down on a dwarven survey chart spread on rough stone: precise tunnel lines in dark ink, Shaft Six terminating in a solid black fill at the edge; Bragni's stubby finger traces the end point while chalk stubs, a brass compass, and a sputtering candle crowd the margins; runic markings present but not readable. Candlelight pools warm amber on parchment and throws sharp little shadows into creases; the black fill absorbs light like a void while the compass edge throws a hard glint. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dead-rune.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The rune—a standard ward against cave-ins—was dark.")
prompt:Close-up of a Stonehold tunnel wall lined with carved protection runes: most glow faint amber from residual blessing, but one rune is perfectly carved and completely dark, empty like a lamp with no oil; soot flakes and grit settle in its grooves while the neighboring runes pulse. Torchlight and the warm rune glow mix, making active carvings look lit from within while the dead rune stays flat and cold, a black gap in the pattern. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: vibrating-crack.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A low vibration, almost beneath the threshold of sensation.")
prompt:Extreme close-up of a leather-gloved hand pressed flat to the wall beneath the ceiling crack: fine stone dust on the surface trembles and lifts in a slow pulse, then settles, then lifts again; breath fog hangs in a cold pocket near the fissure while the surrounding air stays warm. Torchlight flickers from off-frame and catches the moving dust as tiny bright points; condensation beads at the crack edge shine pale against the warmer stone. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, razor-thin focal plane. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: sealed-shaft.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "When the final seal was placed, he pressed his hand against it.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Bragni] Relief that does not reach the eyes; hand lingering as if listening through the stone. Shaft Six sealed behind a dwarven barricade of iron beams driven into rock, blessed chains tensioned across the face, fresh mortar smeared thick between braces, new ward-runes etched into the stonework and glowing faint. Multiple torches along the shaft provide warm amber light that throws hard highlights on iron and makes wet mortar gleam while the rune glow adds smaller points of warmth around the edges. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, deep depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
