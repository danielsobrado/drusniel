## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Bragni's gloved hand stays flat against the stone. For a beat, nothing moves. Then fine dust begins to tremble, lifting a millimeter and settling back in a slow pulse.
[00:03-00:05] His fingers tighten involuntarily as the pulse repeats. Breath fog curls into the cold pocket near the crack and drifts upward.
[00:05-00:08] A single grit fragment drops from above and clicks against the leather glove. The dust continues to lift and settle in rhythm, as if the wall is breathing.

Static extreme close-up, locked off.
Audio: faint torch flutter, deep sub-bass hum felt more than heard, microscopic grit click on leather, a sharp inhale, silence between pulses. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
