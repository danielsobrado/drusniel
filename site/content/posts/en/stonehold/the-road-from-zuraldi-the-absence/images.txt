1. filename: holding-the-void.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Brow furrowed, grip tightening, eyes fixed on the cube as if trying to understand its wrongness. [Face_Reference: Balin] Curiosity fighting fear, leaning closer despite himself. At the roadside under hot afternoon sun, Dulint holds the dark metal cube up and watches its cold blue-white pulse come in uneven waves, too mechanical to be breath, while the empty hills and the long road feel unnaturally quiet. Sunlight is warm and hard from above, but the cube's cold glow adds a second diegetic light source that underlights knuckles and metal edges, creating a harsh warm-cool split on skin and leather. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: absence-sensation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "It felt like... absence.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Confused strain, trying to name the sensation; fingers curling tighter around the cube. Close view of the cube held in both hands as the air around it seems slightly muted and light falls off too fast, as if the object is eating contrast rather than radiating power; dust in the beam hangs and then drifts away in slow reluctant eddies. Afternoon sun provides bright warm top light, while the cube's cold internal glow creates crisp blue-white highlights in the creases of his fingers and along the carved geometry, making the surrounding daylight feel wrong by comparison. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: distant-figures.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "A flicker of movement on the hillside behind them.")
prompt: Telephoto view over the road back the way they came: on a distant hillside, several small figures move in a tight coordinated line toward the road, too orderly to be casual travelers, half-lost in heat haze and dust. The landscape is wide and empty, which makes the movement feel intentional. Late-afternoon sun is hard and bright, washing the hill in pale gold and flattening details, while atmospheric haze softens the silhouettes and compresses distance. Canon EOS R5 200mm f/4.0 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight atmospheric blur. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: war-instincts.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "His war instincts screamed at him—the same instincts that had kept him alive through two campaigns and a siege that killed better dwarves than him.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] The tired merchant is gone; eyes narrowed, face hardening into soldier focus, one hand already on a weapon hilt while the other keeps the cube tight. Dulint shades his eyes against the sun and stares down the road, posture shifting into threat assessment, muscles coiling under travel-worn clothes. Afternoon sun is harsh and directional, casting hard shadows across his cheek and beard line, while the cube's cold glow adds a thin blue-white edge highlight on his fingers and the metal carvings. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: running-start.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He looked down at the artifact in his hands.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Urgency breaking through control, jaw clenched as he commits to movement. [Face_Reference: Balin] Startled compliance, eyes snapping from the distant hill to Dulint. Ground-level action shot as boots scrape gravel and kick up dust; Dulint shoves the glowing cube into the worn leather pack and yanks the strap tight as they start moving fast down the road, the quiet hills suddenly feeling like a trap. Sunlight flashes off airborne dust and buckles, and the cube's cold glow leaks briefly through the pack seam as it disappears inside, creating a sharp blue-white streak against the warm day. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, motion blur on dust, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
