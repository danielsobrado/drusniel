## Chapter | The Road from Zuraldi: The Followers

--- 

The afternoon sun slid toward evening, and the followers didn't fall back.

Dulint had hoped that speed might shake them. A burst of movement, a change of direction, the kind of evasion that had worked during the border wars. He'd been wrong. Every time he glanced over his shoulder—despite his own orders—the figures were closer. Not running, never running, but inexorable. Like water finding its way downhill. Like something that knew exactly where its prey would go and felt no need to hurry.

"Three of them," Balin reported. He'd taken to scouting ahead and doubling back, his younger legs handling the extra distance. The boy was winded but alert, falling into the rhythm of pursuit-and-evasion like he'd been born to it. "Maybe four. They split up at the last fork—two on the road, two through the trees."

"They're flanking us."

"Looks like it." Balin fell into step beside him, breathing hard. "Uncle, these aren't bandits. Bandits don't coordinate like this. Bandits don't track this well."

Dulint knew. He'd fought organized enemies before—minotaur war-bands during the border conflicts, goblin raiders under that warlord Korgath's command. Captain Aldric had told him about Korgath once, about how the half-orc was bringing discipline to forces that had always been chaotic. Random violence had a flavor to it—desperate, opportunistic, clumsy. This wasn't random. This was methodical. Professional.

"How long have they been there?" he asked. "Really?"

Balin hesitated. "Since the cube woke up. Since it started glowing." He looked at Dulint with eyes that held more fear than a young dwarf should carry. "Uncle... coincidence?"

"No." Dulint pulled the artifact from his pack. Still warm. Still pointing. The symbols pulsed with that pale luminescence, brighter now than before, as if the cube was drawing energy from somewhere he couldn't see. "No coincidence."

He turned the cube in his hands, watching the way the glow shifted when he moved it. No matter how he rotated it, one face stayed oriented north-east. Always north-east. Like a compass fixed on something beyond the mountains. Like an arrow pointing at a target only it could see.

But it wasn't just pointing.

*It doesn't give. It calls.*

"It's not just pointing," Dulint said, the realization settling into him like cold water. "It's like a signal fire. Whatever it's doing, hiding from it seems... impossible."

"Broadcasting what?"

"Us." Dulint looked at the distant figures—closer now, shapes resolving into actual forms. Men, probably. Armed, definitely. He could see the glint of steel at their hips, the bulk of armor under traveling cloaks. These weren't casual travelers. "Our position. Our presence. Like a fire in the darkness, visible for miles to anyone who knows how to look."

"That's—" Balin's face went pale. The blood drained from his cheeks, leaving him grey and sick-looking. "That's why they found us. That's why they're following. They're not tracking *us*. They're tracking *it*."

The cube hummed. That bone-deep vibration that made Dulint's teeth ache. Indifferent to their conversation. Indifferent to their fear. It didn't care that they were being hunted. It didn't care about anything at all. It simply pulsed—constant, inevitable, mechanical.

"Move," Dulint said. "Now. Don't look back."

They moved. The road climbed toward a ridge, offering a brief view of the countryside before them—rolling hills, scattered forests, and somewhere in the distance, the lights of settlements beginning to glow in the fading afternoon. Riverhold was still two days away at their current pace. Maybe a day and a half if they pushed through the night. Maybe less if they abandoned caution entirely.

But the followers were gaining. Not fast, but steady. Another few hours and they'd be in bowshot range. Another day and they'd close the gap entirely.

"What is this thing?" Balin asked, his voice raw. "What did we find?"

Dulint looked at the artifact. The symbols pulsed. The heat never faded. The direction never changed.

Something ancient. Something incomplete. Something that had been sleeping for longer than dwarven memory, waiting for a signal to wake. Waiting for a purpose that Dulint couldn't understand.

And now it was awake. Calling. Drawing things toward it like blood in water.

"Something that isn't waiting anymore," Dulint said.

Behind them, the followers broke into a run.
