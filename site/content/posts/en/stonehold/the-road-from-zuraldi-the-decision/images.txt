1. filename: exhausted-hiding.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Sweat-streaked pain, eyes squeezed tight between breaths, shoulders shaking as he fights for air. [Face_Reference: Balin] Frantic steadiness, one hand on Dulint's shoulder, eyes scanning for movement. At the forest edge, they crouch behind the bulk of a fallen oak log, dirt and moss staining their clothes, listening to the steady crunch-step of pursuers outside the canopy while the darkness under the branches feels like the only shelter left. Dim canopy shade is the dominant light, cold and green-tinged, with a thin warm late-day spill at the treeline catching dust and sweat sheen in brief highlights. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: glass-shards-lungs.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Dulint’s lungs were full of glass shards.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Face twisted with cutting breath-pain, one hand clamped to his chest, lips parted as he rasps air; eyes watering. Tight close-up as Dulint stumbles and tries to keep moving, throat raw, sweat and road dust caked into skin and beard, Balin's arm bracing him just out of focus. Late-afternoon light is harsh and warm from the side, catching wet shine on sweat and turning airborne dust into bright specks while deep shadows carve his cheek and jaw. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drop-the-rock.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Balin turned, his eyes wide and terrifyingly rational in the gloom.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin] Terrifying clarity, fear forced into logic, pointing toward Dulint's pack as if the answer is simple. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Torn between survival and the pull he can't explain, gaze dropping to the straps, hands shaking. In the gloom behind the fallen oak, Balin urges him to drop the pack while the cube's heat radiates through leather and wool, the choice hanging in the damp air with wet moss smell and distant footsteps. Low canopy shade keeps the scene dark, but a faint cold blue-white leak from the pack seam and a thin warm rim from the treeline create mixed highlights on fingers and leather stitching. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: thrain-legacy.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "But then came the pull.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Stubborn resolve hardening through pain, eyes lifting with a decision he hates but won't abandon; one hand tightening the pack strap instead of letting go. [Face_Reference: Balin] Grim understanding dawning, knife hand lowering as he realizes Dulint will keep it. Dulint pushes himself up from the log, the burning weight on his back and the cube's pulse felt through the leather, as if old family stories have become a rule he can't break. The only strong light is the cube's cold blue-white glow leaking through the pack seam, throwing sterile highlights on knuckles and buckles, while the forest around them stays swallowed in dark green shade and the treeline spill fades behind. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: push-into-dark.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "They turned away from the noise and pushed deeper into the dark.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] Bent forward with age and pain but moving anyway, jaw set. [Face_Reference: Balin] Close beside him, guarding the rear, fear turned into motion. Wide shot from behind as the two dwarves disappear into tangled forest under dense canopy, the road noise and footsteps behind them fading, while a muffled cold blue-white glow leaks from the pack like a buried ember. The forest is almost black in places, lit only by faint ambient green-blue and the cube glow, which casts tiny cold highlights on nearby leaves and wet bark. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
