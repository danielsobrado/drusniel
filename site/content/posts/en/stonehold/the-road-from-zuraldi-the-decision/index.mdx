They ran.

Dulint's legs screamed. His lungs burned. Sixty-three years—most of them underground, breathing dust and lifting stone—had not prepared him to sprint across open countryside with armed men closing in behind them.

But he ran anyway.

The memories came unbidden. Granite Pass, forty years ago. The minotaur horde breaking through the main defense. Dulint had been young then, strong enough to swing an axe for hours without rest, fast enough to outrun most pursuit. He remembered the feeling of earth shaking under charging hooves, the screams of dwarves who couldn't get clear, the desperate choice between standing to fight and living to fight another day.

He'd chosen to live. Most of them hadn't.

Now he was old. His joints ached. His wind was gone within half a mile. But the instincts remained—the hard-won knowledge of what pursuit felt like, what hunters looked like, when running was wisdom and when it was just delaying the inevitable.

The road turned north, threading between two hills that offered brief cover. Balin pulled ahead, his younger body handling the pace better, then stopped at the crest to wait. He was breathing hard but controlled, eyes scanning the terrain with a scout's assessment.

"There's a forest," he said, pointing. "Half a mile. If we can reach the trees—"

"They'll follow us in." Dulint bent double, gasping. His heart hammered against his ribs. "Forests don't stop people who know what they're hunting."

"Then what? We can't outrun them forever."

Dulint straightened. His hand found the cube in his pack—still warm, still pointing, still humming at that frequency that made his bones ache. He could feel the void inside it now, that absence he'd described to Balin. It pulled at something in his chest. Called to something he couldn't name.

The witch-woman's words echoed in his memory. *You carry a void. A hunger that will draw what sleeps. When the time comes, you must choose—to carry it forward or to let it fall. Either way, the cost will be paid.*

He hadn't asked what she meant. He hadn't wanted to know.

"We could go back," Balin said. "Bury this thing. Pretend we never found it."

"And they'd still follow." Dulint met his nephew's eyes. "They know we have it now. They've been tracking it since it woke up. Burying it doesn't make them forget."

"Then throw it away. Right now. Toss it in the woods and keep running." Balin's voice cracked. "Uncle, I don't want to die on some nameless road because you decided to carry a glowing rock across the eastern lands."

Dulint pulled out the cube and looked at it. The symbols pulsed, brighter now than they'd been hours ago. The pointing face still aligned north-east—toward Riverhold, toward Xandor, toward something beyond the mountains the artifact seemed determined to reach.

He could throw it away. Right now. Hurl it into the forest and keep running. Maybe the followers would stop for it. Maybe they'd let two aging dwarves go in exchange for whatever prize they were hunting. Maybe.

He thought of his great-grandfather, Thrain Ironbeard, who had stolen a map from a sorcerer's vault and walked three hundred miles to a mine that made their family's fortune. Thrain hadn't known what he was carrying or what the map meant. But he'd known it mattered, felt it in his bones the way Dulint felt this cube now.

Thrain had walked forward into danger, into the unknown, and his family had lived on that fortune for generations.

*Maybe some things are worth the risk.*

"Riverhold," Dulint said. "Xandor. He'll know what this is."

"And if they catch us before we get there?"

"Then we find out if I remember how to fight."

Balin stared at him. "You're serious. You'd rather fight than throw that thing away."

"I'm serious." Dulint tucked the cube back into his pack. The warmth settled against his hip like a coal, like a promise, like a threat. "I didn't carry this thing for three weeks to throw it away at the first sign of trouble. Something woke it up. Something changed. And I want to know what."

"Even if it kills us?"

Dulint considered the question. Behind them, the followers had crested the last hill, close enough now that he could see the glint of weapons. Ahead, the forest beckoned—temporary cover at best. The road stretched on, mile after mile, toward a destination that might hold answers or might hold only more questions.

He thought about his life. Sixty years underground, digging ore that made other people rich. Building a legacy he couldn't keep. Watching his family's name fade while younger, cleverer dwarves claimed the chances that should have been his.

"I've spent sixty years digging," he said. "Following seams that led nowhere. Hitting dead ends. Watching chances slip away." He touched the cube through the leather of his pack. "Maybe this is what Thrain felt when he stole that map. Maybe some things are worth dying for, even if you don't understand them yet."

"That's not comforting."

"It's not comforting."

"It's not meant to be."

They reached the forest's edge. The trees closed around them—old growth, dense canopy, the kind of forest that swallowed sound and light. Dulint moved through the underbrush with a miner's instinct for terrain, finding paths of least resistance, gaps that offered cover.

The cube grew warmer against his hip. The symbols pulsed. The direction never changed—always north-east, always forward, always toward something he couldn't see.

Ahead, somewhere, Riverhold waited. Xandor waited. Answers waited—if they could reach them.

Behind, the followers entered the forest. Dulint could hear them now—the crunch of leaves, the snap of branches, the careful sounds of hunters closing in.

He put one foot in front of the other. Forward, into the darkness, toward whatever was waiting.

And despite everything—the fear, the age, the weight of sixty-three years—he walked forward anyway.
