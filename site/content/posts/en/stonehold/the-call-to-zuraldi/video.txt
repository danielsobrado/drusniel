## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The cube's symbols shift faster, and its low hum swells as Dulint and Balin tighten their forearm clasp. Lantern flame wavers as if pulled by a draft that isn't there.
[00:03-00:05] The cube gives a single brighter pulse, spilling cold light up their hands and faces. Dust on the tabletop trembles in place, then settles.
[00:05-00:08] Dulint releases the clasp and covers the cube with his palm for a beat, as if to quiet it. Balin swallows and nods once, the decision made without words.

Slow dolly-in from the clasped forearms to the cube.
Audio: lantern crackle, low resonant hum rising and falling, one sharp metal tick, soft scrape of hands on wood, quiet breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
