1. filename: confrontation-on-road.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Anger and fear tangled together, grip iron-hard as he grabs Dulint's forearm; eyes narrowed, calculating. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Exhaustion breaking through control, jaw tight, trying not to show fear. On the uneven road between gray hills, Balin halts Dulint mid-stride and forces the argument into the open, dust swirling around their boots and pack straps, the silence behind them feeling heavy and watched. Late-afternoon sun is low and warm, casting long shadows across the road and carving hard light on knuckles and leather, with the valley walls cutting the light into alternating bands of sun and shade. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: finding-the-cube-flashback.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "I was the one who pulled it from the stratum,")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Triumphant grin through rock dust, eyes bright with reckless pride, arm buried up to the elbow in shadow. Flashback in the old mines: Balin reaches into a seam in an ancient wall where the geometry looks wrong and the torchlight seems to die, then pulls the perfect dark cube free from impossible blackness, stale dust and ozone hanging in the air. A single torch is the only light, warm orange flicker catching airborne grit and turning the edge of the wall into jagged relief while the gap behind his arm stays unnaturally dark. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: xandor-hope.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The valley deepened, the hills rising on either side to cut off the late afternoon sun.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Desperate hope forced into a plan, eyes fixed on the road ahead as he commits; hand lifted to point. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Skeptical tension, still angry, but listening. Dulint points toward the horizon as he names Riverhold and a last-resort contact, the road hooking left and disappearing between rising hills, shadows lengthening and merging into grey pools as daylight narrows. Low sun throws warm amber across their faces from the side, catching dust in the air and leaving the far side of their bodies in deep shade. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: tagged-realization.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Balin stopped dead.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Horror draining his face, eyes locked past Dulint, lips parting as he realizes the truth; hand hovering near his knife without drawing it. Tight portrait with Dulint blurred in the foreground as Balin stares down the road behind them, hearing and seeing what Dulint has not yet turned to face. Late-afternoon light has gone flatter in the valley shade, making the skin look colder, while a thin warm rim from the remaining sun catches the edge of his cheek and the dust haze behind him. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: fluid-pursuers.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Figures—three, maybe four—had crested the rise.")
prompt: Long shot down the road behind them: three or four distant figures crest a rise and move with an unsettling fluid coordination, no wasted motion, no conversation, their silhouettes too smooth for ordinary travelers as they flow over uneven ground. Heat haze and dust soften edges, but the intent in the movement is unmistakable. Backlit by the low sun, the pursuers are dark shapes against a washed gold sky, with dust trailing in thin ribbons and the road stretching empty between hunter and prey. Canon EOS R5 200mm f/4.0 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight atmospheric blur. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
