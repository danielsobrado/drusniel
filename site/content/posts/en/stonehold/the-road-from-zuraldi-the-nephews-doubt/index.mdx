# Chapter 0.3 | The Nephew's Doubt

---

They walked faster now, the easy pace of travel replaced by something closer to flight. Dulint's knees protestedâ€”they always protested these daysâ€”but he ignored them. Pain was temporary. Whatever was behind them felt permanent.

"I found that thing," Balin said, keeping his voice low. "I was there when we pulled it from the wall. It never did anything like this."

"I know."

"Three weeks we've been carrying it. Not a sound. Not a glow. Nothing." Balin grabbed Dulint's arm, forcing him to stop. His grip was strongâ€”young muscle, fresh calluses, the strength of someone just coming into his prime. "What did you do to it, Uncle?"

Dulint met his nephew's eyes. Sharp eyes, suspicious eyes. The boy was young, but he wasn't stupid. He'd grown up watching dwarven politics, watching deals struck in the dark and secrets buried deeper than ore. He'd learned to question everything, trust nothing, and always watch for the angle. Good instincts. Dangerous instincts, in the wrong hands.

"Nothing." Dulint's voice came out harder than he intended. "I swear it. I've carried it unchanged for weeks. Showed it to the witch-woman in Zuraldi. She looked at it, said some things I didn't understand, and that was all."

"What things?"

"Nothing useful. Prophecy talk. Riddles." Dulint pulled his arm free and started walking again. The road curved ahead, following the contour of the hills. "You know how those seers are. All smoke and poetry."

Balin caught up. "You're lying."

"I'm notâ€”"

"You're leaving things out, which is the same thing." Balin moved to block his path, forcing Dulint to stop. "I've known you my whole life, Uncle. I know when you're stalling. I know when you're rambling to avoid a question. And I know when you're scared."

Dulint said nothing. What could he say? The boy was right.

"I found that artifact," Balin continued. "I reached into that wall when everyone else said it was too dangerous. I touched it first. And now it's doing something it never did before, and you won't tell me why."

The accusation hung in the air between them. Dulint remembered the momentâ€”Balin's hand disappearing into the gap, his face going pale, the way he'd pulled the cube free like a surgeon removing a tumor. The boy had been so proud. So excited. He'd talked about nothing else for daysâ€”the shape of it, the symbols, the perfect geometric precision that no dwarven craftsman could match.

*You should have left it*, Dulint thought. *We should have walked away.*

But they hadn't. And now here they were.

"And now it just... wakes up?" Balin asked. "For no reason?"

"Maybe there's a reason. Maybe something changed. I don't know." Dulint glanced back at the road behind them. The figures were still thereâ€”closer now, clearly moving faster than casual travelers. "What I know is that thing started glowing and pointing about an hour ago, and now we've got company. Coincidence doesn't stretch that far."

"It's pointing north," Balin observed. He'd moved to walk beside Dulint again, matching his pace despite his obvious frustration.

Dulint looked at the cube, still warm in his pack. The heat radiated through the leather, a constant presence against his side. "North-east. Toward the mountains. Toward something."

"It's a rock, Uncle." Balin's voice cracked with something between fear and frustration. "Rocks don't point."

"This one does now."

They walked in silence for a while. The road curved through a shallow valley, offering limited cover but better speed. Dulint's mind churned through optionsâ€”none of them good. Go back to Zuraldi? The followers would catch them before they reached the town gates. Hide? The cube was broadcasting their position to anyone who knew how to listen. Fight? Two dwarves against armed pursuers, one of them past his prime?

"I know someone," he said finally. "In Riverhold. A mage named Xandor. He studies old things. Artifacts. Remnants from before the Sundering."

"A human mage?"

"Half-Zuraldi, actually. Old friend of some people I trust." Dulint had been planning to seek Xandor out anywayâ€”the witch-woman had suggested it, in her roundabout wayâ€”but now the urgency was different. Now they were being hunted. "He's worked with the Aldric expedition. He knows about the organized threat out hereâ€”the Grukmar activity, the coordinated raids."

"And you think he can explain this?" Balin gestured at the cube. "Tell us what we dug out of that ruin?"

"I think he's our best chance of understanding beforeâ€”"

Balin stopped walking.

"Uncle."

The tone of his voice made Dulint's blood go cold. He'd heard that tone before, decades ago, from scouts who had seen something they shouldn't have.

"We're being followed."

Dulint turned. The figures on the road behind them had multiplied. Fourâ€”no, fiveâ€”shapes moving with purpose. Not running, but not strolling either. The steady pace of people who knew exactly where their quarry was going.

"How long?" Dulint asked.

"I spotted them after the cube woke up. Thought they might be merchants, but..." Balin's hand went to his knife again. "They haven't stopped. Haven't rested. Just keep coming."

Dulint looked at the artifact. Still pointing. Still pulsing. Still broadcasting whatever signal had drawn these hunters out of the wilderness.

*A hunger that will draw what sleeps.*

"Move," Dulint said. "Faster. Don't look back."
