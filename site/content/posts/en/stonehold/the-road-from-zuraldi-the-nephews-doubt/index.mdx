They walked faster now, the easy pace replaced by something closer to flight. Dulint's knees protested—they always protested these days—but he ignored them. Pain was temporary. Whatever was behind them felt permanent.

"I found that thing," Balin said, keeping his voice low. "I was there when we pulled it from the wall. It never did anything like this."

"I know."

"We've carried it three weeks. Not a sound. Not a glow. Nothing." Balin grabbed Dulint's arm, forcing him to stop. His grip was strong—young muscle, fresh calluses, strength just coming into its prime. "What did you do to it, Uncle?"

Dulint met his nephew's eyes. Sharp, suspicious eyes. The boy was young, but he wasn't stupid. He'd grown up watching dwarven politics, deals struck in the dark, secrets buried deeper than ore. He'd learned to question everything, trust nothing, always watch for the angle. Good instincts. Dangerous ones in the wrong hands.

"Nothing." Dulint's voice came out harder than he intended. "I swear it. I've carried it unchanged for weeks. I showed it to the witch-woman in Zuraldi. She looked at it, said some things I didn't understand, and that was all."

"What things?"

"Nothing useful. Prophecy talk. Riddles." Dulint pulled his arm free and started walking again. The road curved ahead, following the contour of the hills. "You know how those seers are. All smoke and poetry."

Balin caught up. "You're lying."

"I'm not—"

"You're leaving things out, which is the same thing." Balin moved to block his path, forcing Dulint to stop. "I've known you my whole life, Uncle. I know when you stall. When you ramble to dodge a question. And when you're scared."

Dulint said nothing. The boy was right.

"I found that artifact," Balin continued. "I reached into that wall when everyone else said it was too dangerous. I touched it first. And now it's doing something it never did before, and you won't tell me why."

The accusation hung in the air between them. Dulint remembered the moment—Balin's hand disappearing into the gap, his face going pale, the way he'd pulled the cube free like a surgeon removing a tumor. The boy had been so proud. So excited. He'd talked about nothing else for days: the shape, the symbols, the perfect geometric precision no dwarven craftsman could match.

*You should have left it*, Dulint thought. *We should have walked away.*

But they hadn't, and here they were.

"And now it just... wakes up?" Balin asked. "For no reason?"

"Maybe there's a reason. Maybe something changed. I don't know." Dulint glanced back at the road behind them. The figures were still there—closer now, clearly moving faster than casual travelers. "What I know is it started glowing and pointing an hour ago, and now we've got company. Coincidence doesn't stretch that far."

"It's pointing north," Balin observed. He'd moved to walk beside Dulint again, matching his pace despite his obvious frustration.

Dulint looked at the cube in his pack, still warm. The heat radiated through the leather, a constant presence against his side. "North-east. Toward the mountains. Toward something."

"It's a rock, Uncle." Balin's voice cracked with something between fear and frustration. "Rocks don't point."

"This one does now."

They walked in silence. The road curved through a shallow valley, offering limited cover but better speed. Dulint's mind churned through options—none of them good. Go back to Zuraldi? The followers would catch them before they reached the town gates. Hide? The cube was broadcasting their position to anyone who knew how to listen. Fight? Two dwarves against armed pursuers, one of them past his prime?

"I know someone," he said finally. "In Riverhold. A mage named Xandor. He studies old things. Artifacts. Remnants from before the Sundering."

"A human mage?"

"Half-Zuraldi, actually. Old friend of some people I trust." Dulint had planned to seek Xandor out anyway—the witch-woman had suggested it, in her roundabout way—but now the urgency was different. Now they were being hunted. "He's worked with the Aldric expedition. He knows about the organized threat out here—the Grukmar activity, the coordinated raids."

"And you think he can explain this?" Balin gestured at the cube. "Tell us what we dug out of that ruin?"

"I think he's our best chance of understanding before—"

Balin stopped walking.

"Uncle."

The tone of his voice made Dulint's blood go cold. He'd heard that tone before, decades ago, from scouts who'd seen something they shouldn't.

"We're being followed."

Dulint turned. The figures on the road behind them had multiplied. Four—no, five—shapes moving with purpose. Not running, but not strolling either. The steady pace of people who knew exactly where their quarry was going.

"How long?" Dulint asked.

"I spotted them after the cube woke up. Thought they might be merchants, but..." Balin's hand went to his knife again. "They haven't stopped. Haven't rested. They just keep coming."

Dulint looked at the artifact. Still pointing. Still pulsing. Still broadcasting the signal that had drawn these hunters out of the wilderness.

*A hunger that will draw what sleeps.*

"Move," Dulint said. "Faster. Don't look back."
