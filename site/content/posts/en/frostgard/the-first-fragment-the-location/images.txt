1. filename: ice-cave-entrance.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Reverent focus, fingertips hovering near seamless stone. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Sword ready, eyes narrowed into the dark. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Holding the pack close, shoulders tight, lantern hand steady. [Face_Reference: Maris] Headache-tight concentration, eyes drawn to the fissure like it's pulling her. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Guarding the rear, scanning the ridgeline. Midday on a sheer granite mountainside: a narrow fissure splits the rock from base to crown, hidden behind a ridge so it appears only from the Beacon's demanded approach; mineral-cold air breathes out as wind whips frost dust off the stone. Harsh alpine daylight reflects off pale ice in the crack, and Dulint's lantern adds a small warm pool that catches on the fissure edge and their breath fog. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: map-consultation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "\"Pre-kingdom construction,\" Xandor said, running his fingers along the edge of the fissure.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Fingers tracing the join, awe held tight in his face. [Face_Reference: Maris] Leaning in, eyes tracking the seamless frame as if it should not exist. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Holding lantern and pack, trying not to show unease. [Face_Reference: Eldric, Balin] Watching angles and shadows rather than stonework. Close interaction at the fissure edge: stone fits perfectly with no mortar, no tool marks, as if the mountain was shaped to open; cold mist threads from within onto their hands. Lantern warmth rakes across granite grain and ice crystals, while flat daylight gives cold fill and reveals the seam's unnatural smoothness. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: broken-seal.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "This door had been pushed inward. The ice around the frame was cracked, splintered, forced.")
prompt:Close macro on the ward-ice doorframe deep in the tunnel: thick ice has been shoved inward and fractured, stress lines radiating like shattered glass; splinters and frost shards hang from a perfect seamless stone frame. Lantern light glows warm against the ice while a cold blue-white pulse from the Beacon leaks through canvas folds, making cracks glitter and casting double shadows across the splintered seal. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: entering-darkness.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "They pressed forward single file, Eldric first with his sword drawn, then Dulint with the pack and a lantern, then Maris, then Xandor and Balin guarding the rear.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Leading with controlled caution, blade held ready. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Following close, lantern lifted, pack hugged tight. [Face_Reference: Maris] Tense, eyes fixed ahead, breath shallow. [Face_Reference: Xandor, Balin] Guarding the rear, listening for movement behind. Claustrophobic tunnel shot: crystal-clear ice coats the walls so the mountain's stone bones show beneath; their breath fog hangs and then smears away as they move. Lantern light throws warm pools along the ice while the Beacon's blue-white glow adds cold edges and sharp specular highlights in the glassy wall, reflections skating like faint ghosts. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: ancient-markings.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Ancient markings covered every surface, script that Maris couldn't read, patterns that seemed to shift when she looked away.")
prompt:Detail inside the living-ice chamber: ancient markings cover translucent walls, unreadable script and patterns that seem to move at the edge of vision; at the center, a small fragment on a seamless stone pedestal emits cold light that fills the room as the Beacon answers with a deeper pulse from within the pack. Fragment glow and Beacon pulse create layered blue-white illumination that refracts through ice, throwing shifting highlights and faint violet fringes along etched lines; lantern warmth lingers only as a weak amber at the edges. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in the brightest glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
