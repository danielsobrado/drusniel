## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow push-in starts at the broken ward-ice doorway as lantern light trembles on splintered cracks; cold mist spills out and the chamber hum deepens like a held note.  
[00:03-00:05] The push-in continues past translucent ice walls; unreadable markings seem to shift as the camera moves, and the Beacon inside the pack answers with a tighter, louder pulse.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera settles on the pedestal as the fragment's glow swells; blue-white light refracts through living ice, violet fringes flicker along etched lines, and the hum rises to a sudden bright flare that wipes the scene.

Camera movement: Slow push-in through the doorway to the pedestal.  
Audio: lantern wick hiss, ice creaks and faint crackle, low resonant hum building, cloth rustle, breath fogged exhales, distant wind muted by stone. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
