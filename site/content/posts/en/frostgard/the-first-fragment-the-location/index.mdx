## Chapter 20 | Part 2

--- 

They found the cave at midday.

It shouldn't have been there. The mountainside was sheer granite, weather-stripped and featureless, the kind of rock face that offered nothing but wind and cold. Yet here, tucked behind a ridge that hid it from every approach except the one the Beacon demanded, a fissure split the stone from base to crown. The opening was narrow, perhaps four feet wide, and the air that breathed from it carried the mineral tang of deep ice.

"Pre-kingdom construction," Xandor said, running his fingers along the edge of the fissure. His voice had gone quiet, reverent. "Look at the stonework. See how it joins? No mortar. No tool marks. This was shaped, not carved."

Maris looked. The stone around the entrance was seamless, as though the mountain had been asked politely to open and had obliged. Old. Impossibly old. Older than Frostgard, older than the dwarven mines, older than anything she'd seen in Xandor's books.

"Frostgard uses ward-ice on their sacred sites," Eldric said, peering into the darkness beyond. "Seals that only melt for the right bloodline. I've seen them along the northern passes."

"This isn't Frostgard work." Xandor shook his head. "This predates them. They found it, maybe used it, but they didn't build it."

"Then who did?"

The druid didn't answer. He was staring at something inside the entrance that Maris couldn't see from her angle.

"The door," Xandor said. "There's a door."

They pressed forward single file, Eldric first with his sword drawn, then Dulint with the pack and a lantern, then Maris, then Xandor and Balin guarding the rear. The fissure opened after twenty paces into a tunnel tall enough to stand in, its walls coated in a layer of ice so clear Maris could see the stone beneath.

The door was set into the ice wall at the end of the tunnel. Not a natural formation. A constructed barrier, thick as a man's arm, fitted perfectly into a frame carved from the same seamless stone. Ward-ice, Eldric had called it. The kind of seal meant to hold for centuries.

The door was open.

Maris felt the wrongness of it before anyone spoke. Ward-ice didn't melt. Ward-ice didn't unlock. Ward-ice held until the right person spoke the right words, and even then it took hours of ritual.

This door had been pushed inward. The ice around the frame was cracked, splintered, forced.

"Someone's been here," Eldric said.

"Someone's *here*," Maris corrected. She could see it through the gap: light moving inside the chamber beyond. Not lantern light, not sunlight. Something that shifted and pulsed with a rhythm she recognized.

The Beacon's rhythm.

Dulint looked at her. In the lantern light, his face was all shadows and sharp angles. "How many?"

She closed her eyes and reached for the sense that lived behind her visions. The pressure bloomed immediately, familiar pain, and she pushed through it. One presence. Maybe two. Hard to tell because the fragment's signal was so loud it drowned everything else.

"One, I think. But the fragment is making it hard to read. It's screaming."

"Screaming?"

"Not the right word." She pressed her fingertips against her eyes. "Broadcasting. Like a bell that won't stop ringing."

Eldric moved to the broken door and pressed himself against the frame, angling for a view inside. He held still for a long time. Then he pulled back and his expression was careful, controlled.

"Chamber," he said softly. "Thirty feet across, maybe more. Ice walls. And there's something in the center on a stone pedestal. Glowing." He paused. "I don't see anyone. But there's a second exit on the far side. Open."

"They could have left," Balin said.

"Or they're waiting on the other side."

"Or," Xandor said, moving past them both, "they wanted us to find it."

The old druid stepped through the broken door before anyone could stop him. The light inside flared, then settled. Maris heard him inhale sharply.

"Come," he said. "All of you. You need to see this."

They filed in one by one.

The chamber was carved from living ice, walls translucent enough to show the mountain's bones beneath. Ancient markings covered every surface, script that Maris couldn't read, patterns that seemed to shift when she looked away. The air was cold but not frozen, carrying the same deep hum that the Beacon produced.

And in the center, on a pedestal of that seamless pre-kingdom stone, the fragment waited.

It was small. Barely larger than Maris's fist. But the light it cast filled the entire chamber, and when the Beacon in Dulint's pack answered with its own pulse, the walls sang.

"Don't touch it," Xandor said. "Not yet. Let me—"

But the Beacon had already made its choice. Through the canvas of Dulint's pack, through leather and cloth and the old dwarf's desperate grip, it reached.

The fragment answered.

And Maris's world turned white.
