1. filename: vision-boat-black-water.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Crouching in a small wooden boat, gripping the sides, one hand reaching desperately upward. Nightmare-black water moves thick and slow like oil around the boat, reflecting nothing, void-dark sky with no stars above. Faint volcanic red glow bleeding up through the water from below, catching the hull and his knuckles. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drowning-man-face-revealed.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "She saw his face for the first time.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Expression caught between terror and fierce determination, hair plastered wet against his skull, nightmare-black water lapping at his chin. His face emerges from dark vision-water, the first clear image of the drowning man. Dull volcanic amber light rising from beneath the water surface, illuminating his features from below. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-feels-his-emotions.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "She felt what he felt.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Anguished, tears streaking. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Identical expression of anguish. Split composition, two faces in parallel connected by threads of amber light between them. Maris's side fades into winter forest; Drusniel's side shows volcanic fire and black crystal. Amber threads of light glowing between them as the diegetic source, warm against surrounding darkness. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: entity-encounter-reverb.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Something vast was touching him and she could feel the edges of it.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Rigid in his small boat, nose bleeding, body locked in contact with something ancient. Massive shapes distort the black water surface beneath him, not seen clearly but felt through the warping reflections. Amber light crackling erratically around the boat hull, casting unstable shadows upward onto his face. Sony A7R IV 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: moment-of-connection.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "For one heartbeat, he looked directly at her.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Looking upward with shocked recognition from a small boat on black water. [Face_Reference: Maris] Looking down through layers of dark water and void with equal shock. Their eyes meeting across the barrier between worlds, both reaching toward each other. A single thread of warm amber light connecting them through the surrounding darkness. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
