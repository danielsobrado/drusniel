## Chapter 24 | Part 3

---

Heat.

That was the first thing. Not the gentle warmth of a hearth but a living, breathing heat that pressed against her skin from every direction. The air itself was thick with it, shimmering at the edges of vision, tasting of sulfur and burnt stone. Her lungs rejected the first breath and she coughed, or he coughed, and the distinction between those two things had stopped mattering.

She was inside his experience.

Not watching. Not floating above, detached, cataloguing details the way she'd trained herself to do. She was lodged behind his eyes, feeling what he felt, her awareness wrapped around his like a vine around a column. She couldn't control his body. Couldn't direct his gaze. But where he looked, she looked. What he felt, she felt. And right now, he was terrified.

The place was wrong. A cavern, but not stone. The walls rippled with veins of molten red that pulsed in slow, arrhythmic surges, and the ground beneath his feet wasn't solid. It flexed when he shifted his weight, a thin crust over something liquid and furious. The ceiling was lost in vapors that glowed orange where they caught the light from below. Every surface was alive with heat and motion, as though the cavern were the inside of something breathing.

He was alone. Standing at the edge of a formation that jutted over a drop she couldn't see the bottom of. Below, the glow intensified. Above, shadows moved in ways that shadows shouldn't, curling against the hot updrafts, folding into shapes that almost resolved into something recognizable before dissolving.

His hands were shaking. She felt the tremor in the small muscles of his fingers, in his forearms, traveling upward through his shoulders. Not from the heat. From what stood in front of him.

She couldn't see it clearly. His vision kept sliding off it, the way eyes refused to focus on something too bright or too dark, something the brain recognized as dangerous at a level below thought. A presence. Massive. Patient. It occupied the space ahead of him the way a storm occupies a valley, not by filling it but by changing the pressure of everything around it.

It spoke.

Not in words. The communication arrived as a physical sensation in his chest, a compression of air and intent that her borrowed body translated into meaning without language. The meaning was simple.

*Choose.*

He didn't want to choose. She felt that with absolute clarity. Every part of him was screaming to run, to turn away from the edge and the presence and the heat and scramble back the way he'd come. But his feet didn't move. His body held its ground with a stubbornness that felt like habit, the posture of someone who'd been running for so long that standing still had become its own act of defiance.

Now she saw his hands.

The grey-dark skin she remembered from the earlier visions, ashened at the fingertips, but clearer now. Scars she hadn't seen before. Thin white lines crisscrossing the backs of both hands, and newer marks, raw and pink, across his knuckles. Working hands. Fighting hands. Hands that had been broken and healed and broken again. Young hands, for all their damage. He couldn't have been older than she was.

He lifted his head and she saw, through his eyes, the impossible scope of what he faced. The presence loomed, and around it the cavern walls ran with liquid fire that carved channels in the rock, pooling in depressions, overflowing, flowing downhill toward darkness. The heat was unbearable. His skin had gone slick with sweat and each breath seared his throat.

*Choose.*

The word, the non-word, came again. Heavier. She felt his ribs compress.

And with it came a rush of emotion so intense she lost herself inside it. Terror. But not just terror. Grief, old and worn smooth like a river stone, so familiar to him it had become part of his internal landscape. Determination that felt less like courage and more like the inability to stop. A fierce, burning clarity that she recognized because she'd felt it herself, on the nights when the visions left her shaking and bleeding and she got up anyway. The knowledge that stopping was not an option. Not because stopping was wrong but because there was nowhere to stop to.

He reached forward.

Toward the presence, toward the heat, toward the thing her eyes couldn't hold. His hand extended into the shimmering air and his fingers spread wide, exposing his palm, and Maris felt what it cost him. Every nerve firing in protest. Every instinct howling retreat. He reached anyway.

The contact was volcanic.

Light, or something that wore the shape of light, erupted from the point where his hand met the presence. It traveled up his arm in branching patterns, luminous threads that burrowed under his skin and raced toward his heart. He screamed. She felt the scream tear through his throat, raw and animal, a sound with no dignity and no restraint. The pain was absolute. Not localized, not gradual. It was everywhere, all at once, as though every cell in his body had been lit from the inside.

She screamed with him. Not through his mouth. Through her own, somewhere far away in a frozen forest. She felt the echo of it, a distant vibration in a body she'd almost forgotten.

The light consumed his arm to the shoulder. Reached his chest. And there it found something. A resonance. A matching frequency, buried deep in the space between his lungs, something she recognized with a shock that nearly threw her out of the vision entirely.

The Beacon's signal. Inside him.

Not the Beacon itself. The other half. The counterpart to the artifact in Dulint's pack, the fragment they'd retrieved from the ice cave, the piece that had been screaming north for weeks. Its twin was here. Inside this person. Woven into his body like thread through fabric, so deep it had become part of his architecture.

He carried it the way she carried her visions. Not by choice.

The pain crested. His vision went white, then black, then white again. Through the blinding waves she caught fragments. His face reflected in a surface of molten glass, and for the first time she saw him whole. The grey-black skin pulled tight over angular bones. White hair matted with sweat, hanging in ropes past his jaw. Pointed ears, the tips trembling with exertion. Eyes that burned with the reflected fire of the cavern and something else beneath it, a light that came from inside, faint and desperate and unmistakably alive.

Young. So young. Younger than Balin.

A person. Not a symbol, not a metaphor, not the "drowning man" she'd been calling him in the clinical language she used to keep the visions at arm's length. A person, in agony, choosing to endure it for reasons she couldn't see but could feel. The determination was staggering. The loneliness was worse.

The presence withdrew. The light receded down his arm, leaving marks she could feel as raised heat beneath his skin. He sagged. His knees hit the edge of the formation and she felt the stone's warmth through the thin fabric of his clothing. His breathing came in tearing gasps. His pulse hammered at a rate that couldn't be sustained.

He looked up.

And for one impossible heartbeat, his eyes found hers.

Not the reflection. Not the empty air of the cavern. *Her.* He saw her the way she saw him, a presence lodged behind familiar eyes, an intrusion that shouldn't exist. His expression fractured. Confusion, then recognition, then a raw, startled vulnerability that he couldn't mask because he hadn't known she was there to mask it from.

His mouth opened.

The vision shattered.
