1. filename: message-carved.jpg
role: header
prompt:High angle looking down at a massive dead Frost Giant lying face-down in frost-bitten grass near the ravine; its huge back exposed, hide ice-crusted, and a message has been cut deep into flesh with deliberate strokes (letters implied, not readable), left close enough to be found. Cold first-light sun sits low, casting long shadows across the giant's spine and making frost crystals sparkle; dried blood darkens in the grooves while wind stirs loose ice dust over the body. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: hunters-tracks.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Look at the prints.")
prompt:Low forensic detail of two sets of boot prints in frozen soil and rimed grass: identical size, identical stride, aligned as if the walkers kept formation even here; crushed frost, sharp edges in the impressions, snapped twigs beside the line of travel. Cold morning light rakes across the ground at a shallow angle, throwing long shadows into the tread while ice crystals flash bright highlights. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: beacon-pulse-strong.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He stood over the body with the pack pressed to his chest, the Beacon pulsing inside it, louder now, stronger, as if the fragment's integration had turned up the volume on a signal that was already too loud.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Rigid over the scene, expression carved flat, pack crushed to his chest; breath shallow, eyes locked forward. Tight emotional shot at the ravine edge: the Beacon pulses so hard that cold blue-white light leaks through the canvas in sharp beats, illuminating white knuckles and damp fabric weave. Dawn sun adds a pale rim on his cheek and cloak edges while the Beacon flashes create cold highlights and hard shadows that strobe across his hands. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in the brightest pulses, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: professional-restraint.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "That's professional restraint.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Standing, scanning canopy and treeline, controlled tension refusing to sit. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Holding the pack close, shoulders tight. [Face_Reference: Maris] Exhausted, blood-taste memory still on her lips, eyes unfocused for a beat. [Face_Reference: Balin] Listening hard, jaw clenched. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Watching the trees more than the people. Midday in dense forest cover: the group drinks fast and stays on their feet in a shadowed pocket of trees, realizing they're being handled by skilled pursuers. Muted winter daylight filters through branches, catching wet bark and frost on leaves; no direct sun, only cold green-grey fill and deep shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-vision-face.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Maris focused on putting one foot in front of the other and trying not to think about the face in the vision, the words carved in flesh, the things that hunted them now.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Eyes unfocused, face drawn, blinking like she's seeing something behind her lids. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] A faint reflected presence appears in a dark wet surface nearby (puddle, metal buckle, or knife blade), subtle and uncanny, as if the vision is leaking into waking life. Close portrait in forest shade: damp leaves, dark bark, and a small reflective surface catch a ghostlike second face for an instant without turning into a stylized double exposure. Filtered canopy light creates cold highlights on moisture and deep shadows under eyes, with the reflection just barely brighter than the surrounding dark. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
