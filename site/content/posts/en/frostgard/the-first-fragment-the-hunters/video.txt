## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow pull back begins on the deep fresh cuts in the giant's back as frost crystals sparkle; Eldric's boots stop at the edge of the frame and he freezes, sword half-drawn.  
[00:03-00:05] The pull back widens to reveal the full scale of the dead Frost Giant and the ravine beyond; wind skims ice dust over the body while two disciplined boot-print lines lead away without hurry.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera settles wider as Dulint steps into view clutching the pack; the Beacon pulses once under canvas, a cold flash reflecting off the carved grooves as the group realizes they are being watched.

Camera movement: Slow pull back from the carved grooves to wide scale reveal.  
Audio: cutting wind, frost crunch under boots, distant treeline hiss, a single low Beacon hum, leather strap creak. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
