## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow dolly in begins on Xandor's hovering hands as the Beacon's glow tightens into a narrower pulse; wind tugs cloaks and grit skitters across rock around the open pack.  
[00:03-00:05] The dolly continues; Dulint shifts closer protectively, Eldric's hand drifts toward his sword, and Balin glances between Maris's trembling fist and the light as if waiting for the next vision to hit.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera settles as the Beacon stutters—quick flashes, then a low steady hum—throwing sharp blue-white highlights across canvas weave and knuckles; the group falls silent, listening for footsteps behind them that never quite arrive.

Camera movement: Slow dolly in toward Xandor's hands and the pack.  
Audio: cutting wind, cloth snap, grit scraping stone, faint Beacon hum that rises and falls, soft breathing, distant treeline hiss. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
