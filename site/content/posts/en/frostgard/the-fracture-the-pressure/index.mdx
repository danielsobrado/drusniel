## Chapter 22 | Part 1

--- 

Dulint hadn't slept properly in six days.

Not since the body. Not since the message carved into flesh by hands steadier than his own. The letters lived behind his eyelids every time he closed them: GIVE US THE BEACON. Four words that proved what the seer in Stonehold had told him before they left.

*You will fail.*

He carried the pack. He carried the Beacon. He carried the fragment that had merged with it in the ice cave, changing it into something he didn't understand. And beneath all of that, deeper than bone, he carried the seer's prophecy like a stone lodged in his throat.

They were moving east through dense forest, following Eldric's compromise route that sacrificed the Beacon's desired heading for cover and distance from the hunters. The soldier had been right about the trees. Under canopy, they were harder to track, harder to spot, harder to reach. But harder wasn't impossible, and Dulint could feel the pursuit like a hand resting on the back of his neck.

"Slower," he said as they hit a fork in the game trail.

Eldric turned. "What?"

"The left fork. It goes around the ridge. More cover."

"It adds half a day."

"It adds cover."

Eldric's jaw tightened. This had been happening more frequently over the past week. Dulint choosing the slower path. The cautious option. The route that traded speed for safety. Each time, the argument was sound. Each time, Eldric conceded. But the concessions were getting thinner.

"The right fork is faster and takes us to higher ground," Eldric said. "Higher ground means better sight lines. Better sight lines mean we see the hunters before they see us."

"Higher ground also means silhouettes. We'd be visible from every approach."

"We'd be visible and *armed*. That's better than hidden and cornered."

They stood at the fork and the others watched. Maris, pale and drawn, leaning on her staff like it was the only thing holding her up. Balin, hand on his sword, looking between his uncle and the soldier. Xandor, saying nothing, seeing everything.

"Left," Dulint said.

He said it with the quiet firmness of someone who'd been making decisions for fifty years, and hated himself for every one he'd gotten right because each correct choice felt like proof that the next wrong one was closer.

Eldric took the left fork. He didn't say anything. He didn't need to. The set of his shoulders said enough.

They walked through the afternoon in a silence that thickened with each mile. The forest pressed close, ancient trees draped in moss that muffled sound and swallowed light. Good cover. Poor visibility. Every advantage was also a disadvantage, depending on who was using it.

Dulint clutched the pack straps and tried to think clearly.

The seer had said he would fail. Not *might* fail. *Would*. The certainty of it had been the worst part, worse than any specific prediction. Not "you will die" or "you will lose the artifact." Just: *you will fail.* The most comprehensive condemnation available. No parameters. No conditions. No loophole.

He hadn't told anyone.

How could he? Tell Balin that his uncle was destined to ruin them? Tell Eldric that every decision was already compromised? Tell Maris, who was literally being torn apart by visions, that the person responsible for keeping them alive had been told he couldn't?

So he carried it. Like he carried the pack. Like he carried the Beacon. Another weight on old shoulders that were running out of room.

The compromise had been his idea. East, then north, then west. An arc that would lose the hunters and reconnect with the Beacon's heading. It was sound strategy. It was also delay. Every day spent arcing was a day not spent following the Beacon's signal, and the Beacon didn't understand delay. It pulsed and pointed and demanded with the patience of something that would outlast everyone carrying it.

At dusk, they made camp in a hollow where two fallen trees had created a natural shelter. Eldric set watches. Xandor prepared a meal from their shrinking supplies. Balin gathered firewood, moving through the forest with the new quiet competence he'd developed since the ambush.

Dulint sat with his back to a tree and his hand on the pack and watched the Beacon's light leak through the canvas, pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.

*You will fail.*

When? How? Fail to deliver the artifact? Fail to keep them alive? Fail to be the leader they needed?

The seer hadn't specified. Seers never did. They dealt in certainties wrapped in uncertainty, facts buried in ambiguity, truths designed to be useless until it was too late to use them.

"Uncle." Balin crouched beside him, offering a cup of water. "You need to drink."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You haven't been fine since Stonehold, and whatever you're not telling us, it's eating you from the inside." His nephew's voice was gentle. Not accusing. Not yet. "We can see it. All of us."

"There's nothing to tell."

The lie tasted like ash. Dulint drank the water to wash it away.
