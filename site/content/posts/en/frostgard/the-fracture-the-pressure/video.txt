## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The Beacon’s pulse leaks through canvas in Dulint’s lap, lighting his braced hand in cold flashes. Campfire embers pop and smoke drifts under low branches; the forest feels too quiet.
[00:03-00:05] Balin crouches into frame and offers a cup of water. Dulint hesitates, then takes it without meeting his nephew’s eyes. The next pulse reflects as a sharp blue-white line across the water’s surface.
[00:05-00:08] Dulint drinks. The firelight warms his knuckles, then the Beacon pulses again — brighter — and the shadows of fallen trees swallow the edges of the camp. He lowers the cup and keeps his hand on the pack as if holding the light down.

Slow dolly in from the pulsing canvas to Dulint’s face.
Audio: fire crackle, soft leaf-litter crunch, low distant wind through needles, a faint electrical hum with each pulse, cup clink, restrained breathing, smoke hiss. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
