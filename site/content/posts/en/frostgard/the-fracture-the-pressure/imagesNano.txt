1. filename: trudging-snow.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Eldric, Maris, Balin, Xandor]. Dulint heavy shoulders, grip tight on pack straps; Eldric jaw clenched, scanning; Maris pale and drawn, leaning on her staff; Balin hand on sword hilt; Xandor silent and observant. The group moves east along a narrow game trail beneath dense Frostgard canopy, ancient trunks draped in wet moss, damp leaf litter and exposed roots underfoot, cold breath hanging low. Cold overcast daylight filters through needles and moss in thin grey beams while a faint blue-white pulse leaks from Dulint’s pack canvas and catches on wet bark and staff grain as intermittent rim light; shadows pool deep under the canopy and haze softens the far trees. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: Eldrice-glare.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "\"Slower,\" he said as they hit a fork in the game trail.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint]. Eldric impatience and contained anger, eyes hard over his shoulder; Dulint quiet firmness, one hand gripping a strap like an anchor. At a fork in the game trail under heavy moss canopy, the decision hangs between them as Balin and Maris watch from the side and Xandor stays silent behind. Flat cold daylight seeps through the trees, desaturated and low-contrast; damp moss and bark catch soft grey highlights while the forest behind collapses into deep shadow, moisture beading as tiny specular points on needles. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-stumble.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Maris, pale and drawn, leaning on her staff like it was the only thing holding her up.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris, Balin]. Maris drawn and exhausted, weight poured into the staff; Balin hovering close, protective worry, hand half-raised to catch her. At the forest fork, boots sink into wet leaf litter and moss, the party paused in tense silence listening for pursuit; breath vapor drifts at knee height. Dim canopy light falls in soft grey sheets, catching damp wood grain and dew on moss; a faint intermittent blue-white pulse from the pack adds brief cold edge light along knuckles and staff ridges, then fades back into shadow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: dulint-worry.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Dulint sat with his back to a tree and his hand on the pack and watched the Beacon's light leak through the canvas, pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Haunted fatigue, eyes fixed on the canvas; hand braced on the pack like holding something down. Dusk camp in a hollow formed by two fallen trees, soot-dark fire pit nearby, smoke hanging under branches; the Beacon’s light leaks through canvas in steady pulses. Warm campfire flicker throws amber highlights across wet bark texture and the weave of the canvas, while cold blue-white pulses flare from inside the pack and paint sharp highlights along jaw and beard edge; mixed light creates halation in smoke and reflections shimmer on damp leaf litter. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: beacon-heavy.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "\"You need to drink.\"")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin, Dulint]. Balin gentle insistence, worry held back; Dulint pretending steadiness, taking the cup like it weighs too much. Balin crouches beside Dulint at the dusk camp offering water, the pack close enough that the Beacon’s pulse leaks through canvas between them; forest behind stays black under the canopy. Campfire glow warms hands and cup rim, and cold blue-white flashes from the pack catch in the water surface as sharp specular reflections and carve hard highlights across knuckles; smoke softens edges into halation, shadows deepen behind tree roots. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
