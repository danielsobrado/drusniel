1. filename: trudging-snow.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Heavy shoulders, grip tight on pack straps, eyes forward with sleepless strain. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Jaw clenched, scanning the trail ahead, tension held in his posture. [Face_Reference: Maris] Pale and drawn, leaning on her staff as if it’s the only thing keeping her upright. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Hand resting on his sword hilt, watching the adults’ faces for cues. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Silent, observant, staying close enough to intervene. The group moves east along a narrow game trail beneath dense Frostgard canopy; ancient trunks draped in moss press close, sound muffled, light swallowed, damp breath and cold air hanging low between roots. Cold overcast daylight filters through needles and moss in thin grey beams while a faint blue-white pulse leaks from Dulint’s pack canvas in intermittent flashes, catching on wet bark and staff wood; shadows pool deep under the canopy. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: Eldrice-glare.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "\"Slower,\" he said as they hit a fork in the game trail.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Impatience and contained anger, eyes hard as he looks back over his shoulder. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Quiet firmness, refusing to yield, one hand still gripping a strap like an anchor. At a fork in the game trail under heavy moss canopy, Eldric turns toward Dulint as the decision hangs in the air; Balin and Maris watch from the side, Xandor silent in the background. Flat cold daylight seeps through the trees, desaturated and low-contrast; damp moss and bark catch soft grey highlights while the forest behind them falls into deep shadow. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-stumble.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Maris, pale and drawn, leaning on her staff like it was the only thing holding her up.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Drawn and exhausted, weight poured into the staff, eyes unfocused for a beat as if fighting the next vision. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Hovering close, protective worry in his face, hand half-raised to catch her. Maris leans hard on her staff at the forest fork, boots sinking into wet leaf litter and moss; the others pause in tense silence, listening for pursuit in a world that muffles sound. Dim canopy light falls in soft grey sheets, catching damp wood grain and breath vapor; a faint intermittent blue-white pulse from the pack adds brief cold edge light along Maris’s knuckles and staff before fading back into shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: dulint-worry.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Dulint sat with his back to a tree and his hand on the pack and watched the Beacon's light leak through the canvas, pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Haunted fatigue, eyes fixed on the canvas as if it might accuse him; hand braced on the pack like holding something down. Dusk camp in a hollow formed by two fallen trees: Dulint sits with his back to a trunk, the pack at his side, Beacon light leaking through canvas in steady pulses while the others move quietly beyond the frame. Warm campfire flicker throws amber light across bark texture and Dulint’s hands, while cold blue-white pulses from inside the pack flare through the canvas and paint sharp highlights along his jaw and the edge of his beard; mixed light blooms into soft halation in the smoke. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: beacon-heavy.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "\"You need to drink.\"")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Gentle insistence, worry held back from becoming accusation. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Pretending steadiness, eyes shadowed, taking the cup as if it weighs more than it should. Balin crouches beside Dulint at the dusk camp, offering a cup of water; Dulint drinks to wash down a lie, pack close enough that the Beacon’s pulse leaks through canvas between them. Campfire glow warms Balin’s hands and the cup rim while the Beacon adds cold blue-white flashes that catch in the water surface and carve hard highlights across Dulint’s knuckles; the forest behind stays black under the canopy. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
