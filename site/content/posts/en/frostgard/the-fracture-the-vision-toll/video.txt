## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The Beacon’s pulse intensifies inside the canvas pack and the campfire smoke stutters in the cold air. Maris’s breathing goes shallow as she stares down, unmoving.
[00:03-00:05] The puddle at her feet ripples outward on its own. In the reflection, a submerged hand surges up from below and bubbles burst against the surface in a quick, choking rush.
[00:05-00:08] The pulse drops back to a steady beat. The reflection wavers and fades into dark water again as the ripples widen and die; Maris exhales, fingers loosening around her cup while the fire keeps crackling.

Slow dolly-in from Maris’s profile to the puddle reflection.
Audio: campfire crackle, low wind through pines, faint artifact hum synced to the pulse, wet leaves shifting, soft water gurgle, bubbles popping, one sharp inhale and a slow exhale. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
