1. filename: maris-bleeding-ears.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Resigned dread, eyes unfocused; thin blood trails from both ears down her jaw as she stares at her smeared fingertips. Midday on a cold grey forest trail: Maris sits hard on a fallen log with shoulders hunched while Xandor halts the group behind with a raised hand; damp bark, crushed pine needles, and foggy breath hanging low. Flat overcast daylight is the only illumination, desaturated and harsh; wet bark reflects soft grey highlights and the fresh blood catches a dark glossy sheen along her jawline. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: beacon-loud.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Now it's a shout.")
prompt:Close-up of Dulint’s travel pack lying on damp ground, a corner of the dark metal cube inside barely visible as the Beacon pulses; cold blue-white light leaks through worn canvas seams and rough stitching, lighting dirt, pine needles, and loose straps that tremble as if the air itself is vibrating. Muted overcast daylight becomes flat fill, but the Beacon’s internal glow is the diegetic key light, throwing sharp blue-white highlights on wet canvas weave and metal rivets; faint dust motes and breath vapor catch each pulse as it brightens. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, slight halation around the glow, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: Eldric-realization.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "\"You've been going slow for her,\" Eldric said.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Realization landing hard, eyes fixed on Dulint, jaw set like a soldier solving a problem. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Guarded silence, shoulders heavy, one hand gripping the pack strap as if bracing against the Beacon’s pulse. Tight portrait framing from Eldric’s side: Eldric rises from a crouch beside Maris on the muddy trail while Dulint (older dwarf) sits three paces away in soft foreground blur, the halted group and grey forest behind. Flat overcast daylight fills the scene; a faint cold blue-white leak from the pack canvas adds brief edge highlights on knuckles and strap stitching when it pulses. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus foreground, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-confrontation.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "I'm your excuse.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Exhausted but cutting clarity, dried blood at the ears, eyes locked on Dulint as she says it out loud. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Listening in heavy silence, guilt held behind a steady face, hands still around a cup of water. Intimate campfire-side close-up: Maris sits curled against an exposed tree root with knees drawn up; Dulint sits nearby with the pack on the ground between them, forest falling away into blue-grey dusk and thin smoke drifting past. Campfire flame is the main warm light source from below, flickering amber across cheekbones and bark texture; the Beacon’s cold blue-white pulse leaks through canvas and adds brief icy highlights on the cup rim and Maris’s blood sheen. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: drow-connection.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The connection exists whether we chase them or not.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Eyes unfocused, breath held, posture gone still as the vision takes her. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Submerged panic, lips parted for a breath that won’t come, one hand reaching up through heavy dark water. Vision-like reflection near the early camp: Maris sits beside the glowing pack, and in a black puddle at her feet the surface ripples to reveal Drusniel drowning below, bubbles rising and features distorting with each pulse. The Beacon’s cold blue-white glow is the diegetic key light, shimmering across the puddle surface and carving hard highlights on wet leaves; warm firelight adds a faint amber rim on Maris’s profile while the underwater face stays mostly in cold tones. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight halation in the brightest pulses, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
