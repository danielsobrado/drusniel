1. filename: vast-distance-between-worlds.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Floating in void-space, reaching downward. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] In a small boat on black water, reaching upward. Immense distance between two figures separated by translucent layers of reality, warm connection light dimming with the gap. Fading amber glow from below and cold void-light from above, the two sources unable to meet. Sony A7R IV 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: barrier-visible.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Something stood between them that had nothing to do with distance.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Straining fingers pressed from above against invisible resistance. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Reaching up from below, fingers bent against the same barrier. A translucent barrier distorts light and bends space like heat haze between their hands, neither able to touch the surface. Amber light from Drusniel's side refracting through the barrier, scattering into cold tones on Maris's side. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-helpless-watching.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "She could only watch.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Tears running from eyes that cannot look away, hands pressed flat against an invisible barrier. Suspended in vision-space, watching something below with agonized helplessness. Vision light reflecting off wet tear tracks on her cheeks, amber glow from the world below catching in the moisture. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: vision-snaps.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The vision snapped like a rope pulled too tight.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Recoiling, face twisted in shock from violent disconnection. The vision of black water and a small boat fragmenting into sharp geometric shards flying outward, reality cracking apart around her. Amber light shattering into fragments, each shard carrying its own fading glow against encroaching darkness. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-screaming-alone.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "She was alone in the dark, screaming a name she didn't know.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] On her knees, eyes squeezed shut, mouth open in a scream, hands clutching the sides of her head. Alone in black void, the vision gone, transitioning back to the real-world forest floor beneath her knees. Last traces of amber light dying in the void above her, leaving only darkness pressing in. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
