## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Two hands press toward each other through the translucent barrier. The barrier bends light like thick glass between them, distorting the fingers on each side. Amber light refracts through the surface, scattering into cold tones on Maris's side.
[00:03-00:05] Maris's fingers press harder. The barrier flexes microscopically — a shimmer, a ripple — then holds firm. Her hand trembles with effort. On the other side, his dark fingers mirror her position exactly but cannot reach.
[00:05-00:08] The amber light begins to die. Her hand slides down the invisible surface, leaving nothing. The barrier goes still and cold. Her fingers curl inward, empty.

Static camera, extreme close-up on the hands.
Audio: faint crystalline vibration from the barrier, resonant hum fading, the sound of fingers dragging across glass. A single shuddering breath. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy, shallow depth of field.
