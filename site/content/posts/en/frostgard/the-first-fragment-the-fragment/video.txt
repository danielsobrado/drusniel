## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Handheld push-in as Maris drops like her body disconnects; Balin catches her hard, hands shaking her shoulders while frost vapor bursts from their mouths in the cold chamber air.  
[00:03-00:05] The push-in continues past them to the pedestal; the Beacon and fragment pulse in perfect synchrony, a seam on the Beacon flexing as if something inside shifts.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera holds close as Dulint jolts back to himself, opens his hands, and the fragment clinks against stone; Eldric snaps into motion, turning toward the exit as the hum deepens and the chamber seems to listen.

Camera movement: Handheld push-in from Maris to the pedestal.  
Audio: wet cough and ragged breathing, cloth scrape on ice, low hum rising, faint crystalline ringing, boots scuffing stone, lantern wick hiss. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
