## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The seam between reality and vision pulses across Maris's face. The forest-half flickers — pine needles, frost, grey sky — while the void-half deepens, black water swirling in her eye. Her mouth opens in a silent gasp.
[00:03-00:06] The darkness spreads. It bleeds across the seam, consuming more of the frame. The forest side distorts, bending like a reflection in disturbed water. Her visible eye rolls upward. Blood traces a line from her nostril across the boundary.
[00:06-00:08] The void wins. Darkness floods the entire frame, swallowing the last sliver of winter forest. A faint green glow begins to build from below — the first hint of where she's going.

Slow dolly-in from medium to extreme close-up on the face.
Audio: heartbeat slowing, deep sub-bass rumble building, crackling like ice fracturing, faint whispers emerging from the void side. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
