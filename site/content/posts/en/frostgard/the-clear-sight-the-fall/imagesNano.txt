1. filename: maris-collapse-mid-stride.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Maris]. Body going limp mid-stride, eyes unfocusing, legs buckling. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Lunging forward to catch her. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Reaching too late, hand outstretched. Maris collapses on a frost-covered forest trail between towering pines, fallen needles scattering under her shifting weight. Overcast winter daylight, flat grey light through the canopy casting diffuse shadowless illumination, cold overcast sky reflecting off frost crystals on the trail surface. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: group-scrambles-protect.jpg

prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Cradling her head in thick hands. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Sword drawn, facing outward. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Scanning the tree line, jaw set. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Kneeling, checking her pulse at the wrist. Four travelers forming a protective circle around a collapsed woman on a forest trail, overhead angle looking down. Diffused winter daylight falling through pine branches onto the group, cold grey ambient light casting soft even shadows beneath their bodies on frosted ground. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-eyes-roll-back.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Her eyes rolled back and she was gone.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Maris]. Eyes rolling back showing whites, face slack, thin line of blood from her left nostril, pine needles caught in her hair. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Thick hands supporting her head from below. Maris lies on the frost-covered forest floor, the moment between consciousness and void. Cold winter light from above falling on her pale skin, blue-grey and fading, overcast sky light reflecting off the blood trail creating a faint wet highlight on her upper lip.

Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: vision-pulls-maris-in.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "This isn't how it works. This isn't how it's ever worked.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Maris]. Face half in reality, half dissolving into darkness. One eye reflecting frost-covered pines, the other consumed by black water. Features torn along a seam between real world and vision, pine canopy above bleeding into void below. Cold daylight from the forest side casting natural skin tones on one half, non-Newtonian fluid darkness absorbing all light on the other half, the boundary between them creating prismatic distortion where the two light sources collide. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare. Black water: non-Newtonian fluid, high viscosity, reflecting no ambient light. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: maris-body-defenseless.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Her body was defenseless and her mind was somewhere else entirely.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Maris]. Motionless on the trail, unconscious, face slack. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Closest, hand on her shoulder protectively. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Facing outward, weapon ready. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Pacing with nervous energy nearby. Maris lies still while companions hold a perimeter in the winter forest, vulnerable body contrasted with armed vigil around her. Grey overcast daylight falling flat through the pines, cold even illumination casting minimal shadows, frost on ground reflecting dim sky light upward onto the underside of faces. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
