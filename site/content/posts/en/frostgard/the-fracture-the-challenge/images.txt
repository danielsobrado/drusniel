1. filename: river-confrontation.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Rigid calm under strain, pack straps gripped too tight. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Patience worn thin, controlled anger behind the eyes. [Face_Reference: Balin] Protective, stepping in close to his uncle’s shoulder. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Seated at the water’s edge, watching without looking like he’s watching. [Face_Reference: Maris] Apart from the argument, gaze drawn to the river as if listening to something else. Side-profile confrontation on a muddy bank beside a fast snowmelt river; grey-white water surges over rocks that break the surface like teeth, spray drifting into cold air while the forest canopy crowds the scene. Cold overcast daylight is the main illumination, flattened and harsh; water reflections shimmer upward onto faces and wet cloaks, and a faint intermittent blue-white pulse leaks through Dulint’s pack canvas, catching as brief cold edge light. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight spray on lens, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: dangerous-river.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The water ran grey-white over rocks that broke the surface like teeth.")
prompt:Water-level close-up of the swollen snowmelt river: grey-white current slams into jagged rocks, foam tearing into sheets, spray erupting and freezing as mist in the cold air; the rocks break the surface like teeth, slick with ice-cold runoff. Overcast daylight diffuses through cloud and forest edge, turning the water into a steel-grey surface with sharp specular highlights; splashes throw bright white streaks and droplets toward the lens, shadows under rocks going near-black. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, water droplets on lens, slight motion blur in foam, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: Eldric-accusing.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "This is fear.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Contained anger, voice implied low and cutting, hand gesturing as he names the thing out loud. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Refusing to flinch, eyes tight with denial and exhaustion, pack still on his shoulders. [Face_Reference: Balin] Stepping in at Dulint’s side, protective warning in his posture. Medium shot on the riverbank as Eldric closes distance and accuses Dulint, the grey-white torrent roaring behind them and wet stones and mud underfoot; the rest of the group watches in tense stillness. Cold overcast daylight and river-glare light faces from below, throwing hard highlights on wet fabric and rope fibers; a faint blue-white pulse from inside the pack briefly catches along Dulint’s knuckles and strap edges. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-distant.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris stood apart from the argument, watching the river.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Distant, unfocused eyes, body present but mind pulled elsewhere; staff held like a crutch. Rack-focus composition: Maris in sharp focus at the river’s edge while, behind her, the argument between Dulint and Eldric falls into soft blur; the river runs fast and loud, grey-white over toothlike rocks, spray drifting past her profile. Cold overcast daylight washes her face in flat grey; water reflections add faint moving highlights under her jaw and along the staff wood, mist blooming the edge light into soft halation. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: fording-river.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "We rope together and cross.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Taking point, focused competence, rope anchored at his waist. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Fighting the current, jaw clenched, pack held high with both straps tight. [Face_Reference: Balin] Bracing and watching his uncle, knuckles white on the line. [Face_Reference: Maris] Leaning into the rope, staff angled for balance, breath sharp. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Silent concentration, feet searching for stable stone. Wide shot of the party roped together chest-to-waist deep as they ford the swollen snowmelt river; grey-white water surges around them, slamming into rocks like teeth, spray exploding into mist, rope line pulled taut in a hard diagonal. Cold overcast daylight and bright foam reflections create harsh moving highlights on wet faces and cloth; droplets on the lens and slight motion blur sell the force of the current, shadows under the surface going black. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
