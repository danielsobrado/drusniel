1. filename: river-confrontation.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Eldric, Balin, Xandor, Maris]. Dulint rigid calm under strain, pack straps gripped too tight; Eldric patience worn thin, controlled anger; Balin stepping in protectively; Xandor watching from a rock; Maris distant, gaze drawn to the river. Side-profile confrontation on a muddy bank beside a fast snowmelt river, grey-white water surging over jagged rocks like teeth, spray drifting into cold air, dark forest canopy closing the scene. Overcast sky is the primary light source; bright foam reflections shimmer upward onto faces and wet cloaks, specular streaks skating across water skin. Wet moss and bark show micro-sheen; rope fibers and leather straps catch cold highlights, and a faint intermittent blue-white pulse leaking through pack canvas adds brief rim light on strap edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight spray on lens, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: dangerous-river.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The water ran grey-white over rocks that broke the surface like teeth.")
prompt:Water-level close-up of the swollen snowmelt river: grey-white current slams into jagged rock teeth, foam ripping into sheets, spray erupting and hanging as cold mist, icy runoff slick on stone. Overcast daylight diffuses into a steel-grey surface with sharp specular highlights; splashes throw bright white streaks and droplets toward the lens, shadows under rocks falling near-black. Wet basalt river stones show pitted texture; surface tension creates beadlike micro-reflections that stretch into streaks as water accelerates. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, water droplets on lens, slight motion blur in foam, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: Eldric-accusing.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "This is fear.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint, Balin]. Eldric contained anger, low cutting accusation in his gesture; Dulint refusing to flinch, eyes tight with denial and exhaustion, pack still on his shoulders; Balin braced at Dulint’s side, protective warning. Medium shot on the riverbank with the torrent roaring behind, wet stones and mud underfoot, the rest of the group watching in tense stillness. River-glare uplight throws moving highlights onto cheekbones and wet fabric; cold overcast fill keeps shadows grey, and foam reflections catch on rope fibers as sharp specular points. A faint blue-white pulse from inside the pack adds a brief cold edge highlight on knuckles and strap seams, then dies back into shadow. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, background softened, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: maris-distant.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris stood apart from the argument, watching the river.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Distant unfocused eyes, staff held like a crutch, body present while mind drifts. Rack-focus composition: Maris in sharp focus at the river’s edge while Dulint and Eldric blur behind in argument, spray drifting past her profile, grey-white water tearing over toothlike rocks. Cold overcast daylight washes her face flat; water reflections add faint moving highlights under jaw and along staff wood, mist blooming the edge light into soft halation. Damp wool and wood grain show micro-texture; droplets cling and catch as tiny white points before sliding. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: fording-river.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "We rope together and cross.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric, Dulint, Balin, Maris, Xandor]. Eldric taking point, focused competence, rope anchored; Dulint jaw clenched, pack held high; Balin knuckles white on the line; Maris leaning into the rope with staff angled for balance; Xandor silent concentration, feet searching for stable stone. Wide shot of the party roped together chest-to-waist deep as they ford the swollen river, grey-white current surging, rocks like teeth, spray exploding into mist, rope line pulled taut in a hard diagonal. Overcast sky provides cold fill while bright foam reflections create harsh moving highlights on wet faces and cloth; droplets on lens and slight motion blur sell force. Wet fabric darkens with water, rope fibers show braided texture with slick sheen, and shadows under the surface go ink-black. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
