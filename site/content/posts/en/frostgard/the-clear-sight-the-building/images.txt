prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Standing near the pack, weathered face half-lit by amber glow. Heavy canvas backpack on frost-covered ground, warm amber-gold light pulsing through the fabric in rhythmic surges, casting shifting patterns on pine needles and frozen earth. The Beacon's amber-gold glow from inside the pack, warm against the cold blue forest. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders.
