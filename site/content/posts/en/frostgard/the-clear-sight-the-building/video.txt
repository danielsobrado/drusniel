## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Maris's fingers tighten on Dulint's forearm — knuckles whitening, tendons visible. Her eyes are wide, locked on something only she can see. Her lips part. A tremor runs through her hand into his arm.
[00:03-00:05] Dulint looks down at her grip, alarmed. His free hand hovers, uncertain whether to pry her off or hold her steady. The yellow grass behind them sways in a gust of cold wind. Grey overcast light shifts.
[00:05-00:08] Maris's breathing quickens. Visible breath in the cold air, rapid and shallow. A single drop of blood appears at her left nostril. Dulint sees it. His expression hardens with resolve.

Static camera, tight on the gripping hands widening to faces.
Audio: wind through dry grass, rapid breathing, faint heartbeat building in tempo. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy, shallow depth of field.
