1. filename: black-water-vision.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Body rigid with the seizure of vision, expression gone distant as if she isn't herself anymore. Surreal photoreal vision-space: endless black water thick as oil beneath a sky that feels like stone; a small boat drifts without wake and Maris floats at the surface without sinking, as if the water refuses to take her. No sun, only faint bioluminescent underglow from below the surface that outlines ripples and suspended particles, turning the waterline into a thin sickly sheen. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drow-hand.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A hand reaching over the side, trailing fingers through the surface.")
prompt:Extreme close-up in the vision: a thin dark arm reaches over the side of a small boat and trails long angular fingers through black water; fingertips are grey like ash and the joints bend wrong, droplets clinging and falling in slow arcs. Faint under-surface glow lights the underside of the fingers and makes surface tension and oil-thick ripples gleam, while the boat edge stays in near-black silhouette. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drow-face-mid.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The face was young.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Wet hair plastered down, eyes faintly luminous in the dark, expression desperate but deliberate as he looks directly at her. Close portrait at the waterline: black water distorts the lower half of his face, ripples warping reflections as if the surface is resisting him. The only light is a dim glow from below the water and the faint luminescence in his eyes, creating cold highlights on wet skin and beadlike reflections on the waterline. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: help-me-scream.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Help me.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Mouth open in pain as if forcing sound through water, throat straining, eyes locked forward. Impact moment in the vision: bubbles rise and a shock ripple distorts the black surface, the camera uncomfortably close as the waterline shivers and smears the reflections. Dim underwater glow and eye-luminescence catch the edges of lips and droplets, turning the ripples into warped highlights. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the ripples, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-waking.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "She came back screaming.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Convulsing and screaming, eyes wild, blood pouring from her nose and wetting her mouth. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Holding her shoulders down, terror on his face as he tries to keep her from hurting herself. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Pinning her legs, controlled urgency. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Pressing a cloth to her nose, hands steady, eyes not. Night rest in a shallow ravine: dirt, cold rock, breath vapor, and a pool of blood darkening the ground beneath her as the Beacon pulses across camp. Hooded lantern light flickers warm while the Beacon adds cold blue-white flashes, mixing into harsh highlights and deep shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
