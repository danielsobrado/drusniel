## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Static shot as Maris convulses awake in the ravine; Balin holds her shoulders down while Xandor presses cloth to her nose and blood spills faster than anyone can stop.  
[00:03-00:05] The frame stays locked as the Beacon pulses—cold blue-white flashes washing over faces—while Eldric shifts his weight to pin her legs and the lantern wick sputters, throwing warm light that fights the cold glow.  
[00:05-00:08] Still static; Maris's scream breaks into ragged gasps, breath vapor billows, and the pulsing slows for one beat before returning, as if something far away just answered.

Camera movement: Static.  
Audio: ragged breathing, wet cough, cloth slap and rustle, lantern sputter, Beacon hum and pulse, wind muted by rock, blood dripping into dirt. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
