## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The net snaps taut and whips Varian sideways as loose dirt and roots rain down into the black pit. His dropped sword clatters once and the sound fades into nothing.
[00:03-00:05] Garrick skids to the edge, boots scraping wet leaves, and reaches down as the net swings; rope creaks under sudden weight and the mesh bites tighter with every jerk.
[00:05-00:08] Fog curls inward toward the hole and then stalls, unnaturally still. Footsteps circle somewhere above the frame, and a woman's quiet chuckle drifts through the mist as Varian's struggle slows.

Static camera, locked off.
Audio: rope snap, falling dirt, sword clang fading below, boots scraping leaves, strained breathing, distant footsteps, one soft chuckle in the fog. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
