## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Zikvik sprints across the muddy no-man's-land, bare feet slapping wet earth as fog curls around his shins. Mud kicks up behind each stride.
[00:03-00:05] He stumbles on uneven ground and catches himself without stopping. His hand with missing fingers flashes in silhouette as he regains balance and accelerates.
[00:05-00:08] He reaches the treeline and disappears into a dark gap between two gnarled trunks without looking back. The fog closes behind him as the swamp wind shifts.

Static wide shot with telephoto compression.
Audio: rapid wet footfalls on mud, harsh goblin breathing, wind in dead reeds, a single crow call from the treeline, distant wood creak from the border palisade. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
