## Rude Awakening

Consciousness returned in fragments. First the ache in his limbs. Then the rough scrape of rope against skin. Varian blinked, tried to focus—and found himself staring up into a ring of grotesque faces. Goblins. A dozen at least, crowded around the net, their eyes gleaming with cruel amusement.

*"Look!"* One of them cackled, voice high and grating. *"The mice are awake!"*

Varian twisted against the bonds. Useless. *"Let us go!"* The demand came out hoarse, pathetic.

A spear point punched through the netting and stopped an inch from his eye. He went very, very still.

*"Quiet, meat."* The goblin's breath was foul. *"Or we start carving early."*

## Into the Unknown

They hauled him from the net with rough hands, and his legs buckled the moment he hit the ground. Before he could find his footing, a reeking cloth covered his eyes. Darkness again.

What followed was a nightmare of stumbling and prodding—unseen roots that caught his feet, rocks that bit his knees, the constant jab of spears at his back. Varian lost track of the turns. Lost track of time entirely. There was only the grit between his teeth and the growing certainty that he would die in this forest, far from anyone who might mourn him.

How long since they'd left the Rusty Axe? Hours? Days? He'd failed. That much was clear. Failed his duty, failed Elric, failed every soul in the town he'd sworn to protect. And for what—one moment of misplaced heroism?

## Grim Revelations

An eternity later—or perhaps only minutes, he couldn't tell—rough hands tore the blindfold away. Light stabbed his eyes. He blinked, watering, waiting for the world to take shape.

What took shape was a fortress. Crude watchtowers squatted along walls of sharpened logs, staffed with orcs—massive, tusked, watching their approach with flat yellow eyes. The goblins prodded Varian and Elric forward, through a gate that gaped like a mouth waiting to swallow them.

The stench hit first: blood, smoke, and a foul rot-stink beneath it all that made Varian's stomach clench. They were marched through winding corridors, and he caught glimpses of horror with each turn: cages packed with prisoners so gaunt they barely looked human, offering slabs dark with old blood, pyres crackling with green flame that gave off fumes thick enough to taste.

## An Unexpected Encounter

Then—a grand chamber. Plush carpets. Gilded furniture. So completely at odds with the squalor they'd passed through that Varian wondered if the fumes had driven him mad.

At the chamber's center, sprawled across an ornate throne, sat a figure that stopped his breath in his chest.

The half-orc was dressed in fine silks, jewels glittering at throat and fingers, one leg draped casually over the throne's arm. When he smiled—and he smiled the moment he saw them—Varian noticed his teeth had been filed to points.

*"Welcome, gentlemen."* The voice was a purr, cultured and cold. *"I am Korgath. And you are now my honored guests."*

Varian glanced at Elric. His friend's face had gone the color of old ash.

## A Difficult Choice

Korgath leaned forward, steepling his fingers. *"I have a proposition for you. Your freedom, in exchange for some... information. Nothing too onerous. Just a few details about your city's defenses."*

*"Go to hell."* Elric's voice was steady, even if his hands weren't.

That smile never wavered. *"Now, now. Let's not be hasty."* A gesture, and two massive orcs stepped forward. The instruments in their hands caught the torchlight—cruel things, made for pain. *"I'd hate to see you suffer unnecessarily."*

Another gesture, this time to the guards. *"Separate them. We'll speak to each... privately."*

Guards seized Varian's arms. He struggled, shouted—useless. The last thing he saw before a door slammed between them was Elric's face, pale and set, meeting his eyes.

## Alone with the Enemy

Alone with the half-orc, Varian felt his resolve crumbling like wet sand.

*"I'm not like the others, you know."* Korgath's voice dropped to a near-intimate murmur. *"Half human, after all. I understand the value of civilization."*

He gestured toward a robed figure lurking in the shadows—a druid, by the look of him, face hidden beneath a hood of matted fur. *"My friend here has prepared a special draught. A potion. You'll forget everything that's happened. We'll leave you near your village, safe and sound. Your fellow guards won't come looking. No harm done."*

Relief flooded through Varian so powerfully his knees nearly buckled. They would live. They would forget. It would be like none of this had ever—

*"But first."* Korgath's smile sharpened. *"The information. Just to ensure its accuracy, you understand."*

The cages they'd passed. The offering slabs. That woman's voice, screaming for help in the dark.

*"I'll tell you."* The words came out barely louder than a breath. *"Whatever you want to know."*

Varian did. Guard rotations, weak points in the walls, the secret tunnels meant for evacuation—it all poured out of him while Korgath listened with that satisfied gleam in his eye, nodding occasionally, never interrupting.

When Varian fell silent, Korgath clapped his hands. *"Excellent! You see? Cooperation makes everything so much simpler."*

## The Truth Revealed

They led him away. Through the closing door he caught a glimpse of Elric being brought in, face twisted between anguish and dread.

Time crawled. Varian waited in a small stone cell, alone with his fear and his shame, until the door scraped open and Elric was shoved in beside him. His friend looked pale. Defeated. The same look, Varian suspected, that he himself wore.

Korgath appeared in the doorway, and that smile had grown wider, showing every one of those filed teeth.

*"And now, my friends, I believe our business is concluded."* He turned to the druid. *"They're yours now. I trust you'll find them... useful."*

> "The greatest deceptions often come wrapped in the guise of kindness."

The meaning took a moment to penetrate. When it did, Varian lunged—a hoarse shout tearing from his throat, hands reaching for Korgath's neck—but the guards were faster, grabbing him and driving him back.

The last thing he saw before they shoved a hood over his head was Korgath's face. Still smiling. Satisfied.

In that moment, Varian understood what despair truly meant.
