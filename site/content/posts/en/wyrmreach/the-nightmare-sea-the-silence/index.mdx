## Chapter 9 | Part 3

--- 

Drusniel couldn't feel his hands anymore.

They were still there—he could see them gripping the oars, watch them pull through resistance that came and went—but sensation had departed. Numbness had spread from his fingers up through his wrists, claiming territory with each stroke.

*How long have I been rowing?*

He didn't know. Time was broken here. Could have been hours. Could have been days. The grey light never changed. The horizon never got closer or further. He simply... rowed.

His magic was nearly gone. He could feel the hollow space in his chest where his reserves should have been, scraped empty by the artifact's grinding suppression and his own desperate workings. One more push, maybe. Perhaps two if he was willing to risk permanent damage.

*Just keep rowing. Shore has to be somewhere.*

But did it? The nightmare sea was a crossing, Zaelar had said. Things survived it. But what if the shore was days away? What if his strength gave out first? What if—

The boat lurched.

Not from a wave. From nothing. The hull simply *tilted*, as if the water beneath had changed its mind about density. Drusniel grabbed the sides, but his numb hands couldn't grip properly, and he slid sideways, crashing against the gunwale.

Water sloshed. The boat rocked. And something beneath—something vast that he'd thought had left—stirred again.

His water affinity screamed at him. The presence was rising. Fast. Coming from depths that shouldn't exist, moving with purpose that terrified him.

Drusniel reached for his air magic.

The last working came reluctantly, fighting through the artifact's suppression, scraping the bottom of reserves that had nothing left to give. Air formed around the boat—not wind this time, just breathable atmosphere, a shell of normal physics in this broken place.

It wasn't enough.

A wave rose ahead of him. Not a swell. A *wall*—black water reaching upward in defiance of gravity, climbing toward a sky that didn't exist. The wave hung there, suspended, and Drusniel could feel attention pressing down on him from its crest.

The thing beneath had stopped rising. It was waiting. Watching to see what he would do.

He did the only thing he could—he rowed into the wave.

He did the only thing he could—he rowed into the wave.

The bow struck the wall of water, and reality broke.

*He was in the water. No boat. No oars. Just him and the nightmare sea, and he was sinking.*

*The black water filled his lungs.*

*Not like drowning—this was worse. The substance didn't fight to enter, it simply replaced what was inside him. One moment there was air in his chest. The next moment there was darkness, heavy and absolute, pressing outward from within.*

*His body convulsed. Instinct demanded he cough, expel, fight—but there was nothing to cough against, no surface to reach, no direction that meant anything. His limbs flailed in the nothing-water, accomplishing nothing, going nowhere.*

*How did he get here? Where was the boat?*

*The questions didn't matter. Only drowning mattered. Only the fact that he was dying, had always been dying, would always be dying in this endless moment.*

*The thing below him rose.*

*Not attacking. Rising. Getting closer in a way that wasn't quite movement, as if the space between them was simply becoming less. Drusniel could feel its attention like physical weight, pressing down on his consciousness, patient and inevitable.*

*It's waiting*, *he realized.* *It's waiting for me to stop.*

*His vision was narrowing. Grey at the edges, darkening toward the center. The pale, sourceless light was fading, or maybe his ability to perceive it was fading. Same result either way.*

*He had no magic left. Nothing to give. Nothing to trade. He was empty, hollow, scraped clean.*

*This is what death feels like*, *he thought.* *Not pain. Just... ending.*

*This is what death feels like*, *he thought.* *Not pain. Just... ending.*

*He thought of Annariel.*

*Not the false Annariel, the construct of blood and magic that had tried to manipulate him. The real one. His friend. The one he'd never properly said goodbye to, the one he'd left behind without explanation, the one who probably thought he'd abandoned her for reasons she'd never understand.*

*I should have told you*, *he thought.* *I should have explained.*

*The darkness pressed closer.*

*I should have—*

*Sound stopped.*

*Not faded.* *Stopped.* *Complete and absolute silence, deeper than the absence of noise, deeper than anything he'd ever experienced. The nothing-water around him went still, perfectly and impossibly still, as if the entire nightmare sea was holding its breath.*

*The thing below froze.*

*And in the silence—in that impossible, perfect, world-ending silence—something spoke.*

*Not words. Not sound. Something older than language, older than thought, pressed directly into his fading consciousness with the weight of mountains and the patience of eons.*

*It didn't introduce itself.*

*It didn't explain.*

*It simply offered.*

*Live*, *the silence said.* *Owe.*

*Two concepts, pressed into his mind like brands. Survival, if he wanted it. A favor, owed in return. No terms specified. No negotiation possible. No explanation of what the favor might be or when it would be called.*

*Just the offer. Just the choice.*

*Yes*, *he thought. Or screamed. Or begged.*

Pain exploded across his chest.

Drusniel's eyes snapped open. He was in the boat—still in the boat, had never left the boat. The oars were clenched in his white-knuckled hands. Water sloshed around his calves. The wave he'd rowed into was gone, or had never existed, or had decided to let him pass.

His lungs burned with real air, not darkness. His magic was empty but present—depleted, not stolen. The artifact pulsed against his sternum, regular and cold, no longer screaming.

*What—*

The vision. The drowning. It hadn't been real. Couldn't have been real. He was in the boat. He had been in the boat the entire time. His exhaustion and the artifact's suppression had combined with this broken place to create a waking nightmare, a hallucination so vivid he'd believed he was dying.

But his chest ached. Not from exertion. From something else. A pressure that hadn't been there before. A weight that felt almost like—

*No.*

The debt. The offer. The thing in the silence that had promised him life in exchange for a favor owed.

That had been real.

Drusniel stared down at his hands, still gripping the oars. Still rowing. His body had continued the motions even while his mind had been drowning in visions. Muscle memory. Survival instinct. Pure stubborn refusal to stop.

How long had he been trapped in that nightmare? Minutes? Seconds? Time didn't work here. He couldn't know.

What he did know was that something had spoken to him. Something had offered him a bargain. And in his desperation, his certainty that he was dying, he had accepted.

What he did know was that something had spoken to him. Something had offered him a bargain. And in his desperation, his certainty that he was dying, he had accepted.

Whether the drowning had been real or hallucination didn't matter.

The debt was real. He could feel it in his chest, anchored beside his heart, a weight that hadn't existed before. A favor owed to something he'd never seen. A price he didn't understand.

The boat rocked gently beneath him. The oars moved through water that was still wrong, still impossible, but slightly less hostile than before. As if something had changed. As if a bargain had been struck and the sea was acknowledging it.

Drusniel didn't stop rowing. Couldn't stop. His body was running on fumes and fear and the stubborn insistence that he'd come too far to quit now.

The grey light ahead shifted. Not much. Just enough to suggest distance, direction, the possibility of an end to this crossing.

He rowed toward it.
