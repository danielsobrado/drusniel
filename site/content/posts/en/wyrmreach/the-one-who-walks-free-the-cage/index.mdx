## Chapter 13 | Part 1

--- 

The cage swayed with each rut in the road.

Drusniel had counted the guards seven times now. Seven guards. Four wagons. Eleven prisoners total, spread across three cages. The fourth wagon carried supplies and the slavers' personal effects.

*Seven. Four. Eleven. Three.*

The numbers were something to hold onto. Something solid while everything else had become uncertain.

Three days since Merrik's betrayal. Three days of iron bars and rough wooden floors and the constant, grinding movement of wheels over terrain that was never quite smooth. His magic remained depleted—a hollow space in his chest where power should have been. The artifact pressed against his skin, cold and silent, offering nothing.

The other prisoners avoided him.

He'd noticed that on the first day. The way they pressed against the far bars when he moved. The whispers that stopped when he looked their direction. *Drow.* The word carried different weight here than it had in Astalor, where his kind were rare but not remarkable. In Wyrmreach, apparently, drow were something to fear.

Or something to sell.

*Healthy stock,* Merrik had said. *The eastern markets pay premium.*

Drusniel filed the information away. Eastern markets meant eastern buyers, which meant the caravan was heading toward civilization of some kind. Civilization meant opportunity. He just needed to survive long enough to find it.

The landscape outside his cage was strange and hostile. Black sand gave way to rock formations that shouldn't exist—twisted spires of stone that looked like frozen screams, crystal growths that caught the dim light and scattered it in wrong directions. The sky remained that constant twilight, neither day nor night, with the volcanic glow pulsing on the horizon like a distant heartbeat.

*One hundred and forty-seven cracks in the cage bars since the last guard rotation. He'd traced them all twice now.*

His tracing was automatic. A habit born of having nothing else to do, nowhere else to direct his analytical mind. He traced the bars, traced the grain of the wood, traced the patterns in the stone floor beneath him.

And he watched the creature in the far cage.

It hadn't moved in hours.

The guards called it demon-possessed. The other prisoners called it nothing at all—they refused to look at it, refused to acknowledge its existence, as if ignoring it might make it disappear. But Drusniel watched, because watching was what he did, and because the creature was the most interesting thing in this miserable caravan.

Grey skin. Not the grey-purple of drow, but a flat, ashen grey that looked like stone come to life. Red markings across its face and arms—war paint or natural coloring, he couldn't tell. Elongated features that suggested elven ancestry but weren't quite right. And eyes that watched him back with an intensity that should have been unsettling.

Should have been. Wasn't.

Drusniel had been watched by things far more dangerous than a caged prisoner. He'd been watched by the Voice in the nightmare sea, by the things that moved in the deep, by Merrik's calculating eyes measuring his value. This creature's attention was different. Curious. Patient.

*Intelligent.*

That was what the guards missed when they called it a demon. Demons didn't watch with that kind of focused interest. Demons didn't wait. This creature was studying him the same way he was studying it, cataloging details, forming conclusions.

The wagon hit a particularly deep rut, and Drusniel's cage swung hard against its restraints. He grabbed the bars to steady himself, and across the distance between them, the creature's lips twitched.

Almost a smile.

Drusniel didn't smile back. But he filed that away too: the creature was aware, responsive, capable of social cues. Whatever it was, it wasn't mindless.

*Twenty-three prisoners have been sold since the caravan began, according to the guards' conversations. The eastern markets are three more days away. That leaves time.*

Time for what, he wasn't sure. His magic was still recovering, still that hollow ache where power should flow. His body was weak from the crossing and the betrayal and the days of nothing but stale bread and water that tasted like copper. He had no weapons, no allies, no plan.

But he had time. And a cage full of questions.

And across the gap between wagons, a creature that watched him like it was waiting for something.
