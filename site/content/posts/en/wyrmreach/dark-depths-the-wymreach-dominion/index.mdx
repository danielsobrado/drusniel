## Lore | The Mysteries of the Wyrmreach Dominion

The compass stopped making sense on the third day.

Vorogarth checked it again, tilting the brass case toward what he believed was north. The needle swung lazily, then pointed behind him. Then it pointed down.

He closed the case and put it away. Some tools stopped working here. You learned to stop trusting them.

"Keep moving," he said. His voice sounded wrong—flattened, as if the air itself refused to carry it properly.

Behind him, the survey team stumbled forward. Three scholars, two guards, and the cartographer Helvine, who had stopped speaking two days ago. She walked with her hands pressed against her temples, her eyes fixed on something none of them could see.

The ground beneath their boots was gray. Not rock. Not sand. Something in between, with a texture like dried skin. It crunched faintly with each step, and Vorogarth tried not to think about what might be underneath.

"How much farther?" one of the scholars asked. Aldric. Young. Still believed maps meant something.

Vorogarth didn't answer. The landmark they were seeking—a spire of black glass mentioned in the Seventeenth Expedition's records—should have been visible by now. According to the measurements.

According to the measurements, they should also have crossed a river yesterday. They hadn't seen water since entering.

"The spire was three leagues northeast of the bone plain," Aldric said, consulting his notes. His hands shook as he read. "We've traveled six leagues. We should be past it."

"Maybe the spire moved," one of the guards muttered.

No one laughed.

The sky above them was the color of a bruise—deep purple fading to yellow at the edges, though there was no sun. Light came from everywhere and nowhere, casting no shadows. Vorogarth had stopped looking up after the first day, when he'd seen something in the clouds that looked back.

Helvine stopped walking.

Vorogarth turned. "Helvine. We need to keep moving."

She didn't respond. Her hands dropped from her temples. Her eyes were wide, staring at a patch of ground to her left.

"There's a door," she whispered.

Vorogarth looked. He saw gray earth, cracked and dry. "There's nothing there."

"There's a door," she repeated. "It's been there the whole time. We've been walking past it for hours."

The other scholar, Brennis—older, supposedly experienced—stepped closer to examine the spot. He crouched, brushed his hand across the ground, then froze.

"She's right," he said. His voice cracked. "There's a seam. I can feel it."

Vorogarth walked over. He knelt beside Brennis and pressed his palm against the gray surface.

Cold.

Not cold like winter. Cold like absence. Like the ground was pulling heat from his hand and offering nothing back.

His fingers found the edge. A line, straight and deliberate, cut into the earth.

*That was impossible.* They had walked this path twice already, circling back when the landmarks failed. There had been no door. No seam. Nothing.

"Don't open it," one of the guards said. Tomas. The veteran. His hand rested on his sword hilt, though what good a sword would do here, Vorogarth couldn't imagine.

"We have to document it," Aldric said, already scribbling in his journal. "This could be significant. A structure. Evidence of—"

"Evidence of what?" Tomas interrupted. "Who builds doors in places like this?"

Vorogarth didn't have an answer.

He gripped the edge of the seam and pulled.

The ground opened silently, folding back like skin peeled from fruit. Beneath it, stairs descended into darkness—smooth, even stairs, carved with a precision that seemed obscene in this place of wrongness.

Cold air rose from below, carrying a smell Vorogarth couldn't name. Not decay. Not sulfur. Something older than both.

"I'll go first," he said.

"No." Brennis grabbed his arm. "We should mark the location and return to the Rift. Report this. Bring a proper team."

"The Rift is eight days behind us," Vorogarth said. "Maybe. If we can find it again."

He looked at the stairs. He didn't want to descend. Every part of him screamed against it.

But that was the mission. Document. Record. Understand.

He stepped onto the first stair.

The darkness didn't behave like darkness should. It didn't retreat from him; it thickened. His lantern—standard issue, blessed oil, should have burned for hours—guttered and died within three steps.

He kept descending anyway.

Behind him, he heard the others following. Helvine's breathing. Aldric's prayers. The scrape of Tomas's sword leaving its sheath.

Twenty stairs. Thirty. The temperature dropped until Vorogarth could see his breath—except he couldn't see anything at all. The dark was absolute.

Then his foot found level ground.

And around him, something began to glow.

Not light. Not fire. Something that made light look crude by comparison.

Shapes resolved in the glow—walls of smooth black stone, covered in writing he didn't recognize. Symbols that seemed to move when he looked at them directly, settling only when viewed from the corner of his eye.

Helvine walked past him, drawn toward the far wall.

"Don't touch anything," Vorogarth said.

She wasn't listening.

Her hand pressed against the symbols. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then she screamed.

The sound filled the chamber, bouncing from wall to wall, multiplying until it seemed like a dozen Helvines were screaming at once. She fell backward, clutching her hand.

Vorogarth caught her. Her palm was unmarked—no burn, no wound, no visible damage.

But her eyes were wrong.

Her left eye was still brown. Her right eye was not.

"I saw it," she whispered. "I saw what's underneath. Underneath all of it. The layers. The—" She choked on the words. "We have to go. We have to go now. It knows we're here."

"What knows?" Aldric demanded. "What did you see?"

Helvine looked at him with her mismatched eyes. "I don't know how to describe it. It was like looking at a— a diagram of the world, but wrong. The lines were in the wrong places. Everything was connected to everything else, and the connections were *screaming*."

Tomas grabbed her arm. "We're leaving. Now."

No one argued.

They ran for the stairs. Vorogarth counted the steps on the way up—thirty-seven. He was certain he had counted fewer going down.

When they emerged, the sky had changed color. The bruise-purple had darkened to something closer to black. The light came from a different direction now.

The door in the ground was gone.

"It was here," Brennis said, circling the spot. "Right here. I felt the seam."

There was no seam. Only gray earth, unbroken.

Vorogarth looked at Helvine. She was staring at the sky with her wrong eyes, her lips moving silently.

"Can you still see it?" he asked quietly.

She nodded, once.

"Can you find the way back to the Rift?"

A long pause. Then: "Maybe. The paths are different now. But I think—I think something wants us to leave. I can feel it pushing."

"Pushing toward what?"

Helvine pointed. The direction had no meaning—wasn't north, south, east, or west. But something in Vorogarth's gut told him she was right.

"We walk that way," he said.

The team followed.

Three days later, they stumbled through the Rift, into a world where compasses worked and shadows fell properly. Vorogarth filed his report with the Tower of the Watching Eye, leaving nothing out.

The High Archivist read it twice, then placed it in the sealed archives.

"This will not be shared," she said. "The information could cause panic."

"What about Helvine's eyes?" Vorogarth asked.

The High Archivist looked at him with an expression he couldn't read. "Helvine never returned from the expedition."

Vorogarth opened his mouth to object—Helvine was in the next room, waiting to be questioned—then stopped.

Something in the Archivist's tone made him understand.

Helvine had returned. But whoever walked out of Wyrmreach *wearing her face* was no longer considered part of the expedition.

Whatever she had seen, whatever she now saw with that wrong eye—the Tower had decided it was better not to know.

Vorogarth collected his payment and left. He never filed another expedition request.

Some nights, in the taverns of Erbstadt, men ask him about Wyrmreach. What it's like. What lives there. What secrets wait to be discovered.

He tells them the same thing every time.

"I don't know what Wyrmreach is. I only know what it isn't."

They always lean closer.

"It isn't a place," he says. "Places make sense. Places have rules. Wyrmreach doesn't want to be understood. It just wants you to look. And once you look—"

He never finishes the sentence.

He doesn't have to.
