1. filename: cannot-leave-the-writing-alone.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Exhausted fixation, eyes rimmed, brow tight; fingertips traced raw. Kneeling too close to the wall, he drags fingers across carved grooves and broken fragments, trying to piece meaning from scars in black glass; dust and moisture cling to the cuts and vanish when he shifts his hand away. Cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence provides weak raking light that makes groove edges flare with razor specular highlights and throws ghost reflections across the glossy obsidian floor while shadows stay cool and dense. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: fragments-and-survival-notes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "But not all the writing was cosmic.")
prompt:Macro close-up of vitreous obsidian with precise scholar-cut grooves scattered like a broken library, sections violently gouged out, and lower down hurried scratch marks cut shallow and uneven by a different hand; dust and condensation beads sit in the lines. Cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence skims the black polish, producing razor specular streaks along groove edges and deep shadow inside gouges; faint ghost reflections shimmer in the surrounding stone with each pulse. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dual-nature-as-a-key.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel sat in the darkness for a long time, thinking.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Staring into nothing, jaw tight, eyes unfocused; one hand pressed to sternum as if feeling heat through cloth. He sits on the cave floor with his back to black-glass stone, letting fragments settle into a pattern he doesn't want while the carved wall waits out of reach in darkness. Ceiling cyan phosphorescence pulses faintly, painting soft top-light over slack hands and casting long falloff into black; a brief blue-white Beacon leak adds a hard edge on knuckles and bounces as tiny points in nearby condensation. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: srietz-warns-about-knowing.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Srietz will say this: knowledge is weight.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . Eyes calculating, posture curled and guarded; mouth flat as he delivers the warning. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Burdened and restless, gaze flicking away, shoulders tight. Back in the main chamber, they speak in low voices while the cave air stays hungry and still, wet obsidian turning the phosphorescent pulses into dim mirrors behind them. Cold cyan ceiling glow gives weak top-light, catching pores and moisture at the inner eye corners and leaving hard shadows under brows; reflections jitter with each pulse. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: counting-hours-and-waiting.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel settled against the wall and resumed counting hours.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Eyes fixed on the cave mouth, lips counting; posture rigid from hours without sleep. He settles against the wall and resumes counting time, willing Elion to return, while carved fragments and gouged-out warnings disappear into shadow behind him. Slow ceiling phosphorescence throws soft cyan top-light that skims wet stone, creating dim mirrored reflections and sharp specular points on condensation; the entrance remains a black cutout and his face stays half in shadow. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
