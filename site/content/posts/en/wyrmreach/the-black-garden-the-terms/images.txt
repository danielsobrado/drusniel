1. filename: talryn-arrives-at-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Professional interest with no warmth, posture of an officer; earth-toned armor and a belt of neatly organized pouches. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Exhaustion held in a rigid face, eyes lifting after a sleepless night on petals. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Tense and wary, scanning the doorway. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Seated against the wall, eyes open, body too still to be comfortable. Dawn at the entrance of a flower-woven shelter: thick stems woven into walls, floor carpeted in dried petals; outside, endless rows of black-violet flowers fade into chemical haze. Cold dawn light pours through the doorway in a flat blue-grey sheet while a single dying candle-stub inside throws weak warm flicker across petals and woven stems, mixed light leaving hard shadows behind the weave. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: talryn-drops-provisions.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Talryn stepped inside and set a pack on the floor.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Efficient authority, clipped focus as she drops a supply pack. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Silent, guarded packing, eyes flicking once to the doorway. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Tight posture, hands moving fast, distrust held behind stillness. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Watching the entrance without blinking, perfectly still. Inside the flower-woven shelter, petals and crushed blooms cover the floor; thick stems form walls with gaps that reveal shadowed flowers outside, and the air carries a chemical tang. Cold dawn spill from the doorway cuts across the scene while dim candle-stubs add weak warm points on petal edges and leather straps, haze blooming the highlights into soft halation. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: march-through-black-flowers.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "They packed in silence and followed Talryn out of the flower-woven structure into a morning that smelled like chemicals and looked like a painting done in shades of black and violet.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Leading with practiced certainty, pace of someone who’s walked this route a thousand times. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Tired eyes, voice low toward Srietz, keeping hands still. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Close at his side, ears twitching, listening. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Bringing up the rear, attention split between path behind and guide ahead. Wide tracking shot on a narrow path cutting through endless rows of cultivated black-violet flowers; petals angle subtly toward the travelers, and chemical haze turns the morning into a muted painting of black, violet, and grey. Cold morning daylight through haze flattens the world while dew on petals throws violet specular sheen and soft reflections onto boots and cloth edges, mixed light leaving the rows ahead half-lost in blur. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: talryn-sends-a-signal.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Pressed it twice during the morning march.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Spider-still patience, gaze fixed down the path behind; one gloved hand casually presses a small concealed signaling device inside her belt pouch. Midday halt in a small clearing marked by regular use: fire pit stones, stacked provisions, and a simple water source; Drusniel and the others eat in wary silence blurred behind her, flowers rustling at the perimeter like listeners. Hard midday daylight cuts clean shadows across stone and cloth, while violet sheen from nearby petals adds cold edge highlights on the pouch and glove, reflections skating across worn leather; no markings readable on the device. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: watched-march.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The flowers watched them go.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Ahead on the path, unhurried, never looking back. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Following with heavy, thoughtful posture, eyes forward, carrying new debt in silence. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Close at his side, tight and quiet. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, At the rear, head turning to check behind, cataloging. Closing march shot from slightly behind at waist height as black flowers line the path and seem to watch them go, petals tracking their movement in the still chemical air. Late-day light filters through haze in a cold grey sheet while dew and petal sheen throw faint violet glints along the corridor edges, shadows pooling between rows like ink. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
