1. filename: talryn-arrives-at-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn, Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Talryn professional interest with no warmth, officer posture; Drusniel exhaustion held rigid; Srietz tense and scanning; Elion eyes open, body too still. Dawn at the entrance of a flower-woven shelter: thick stems woven into walls, floor carpeted in dried petals, doorway framing endless rows of black-violet blooms fading into chemical haze outside. Cold dawn light pours through the doorway as a flat blue-grey sheet while a single dying candle-stub inside throws weak warm flicker across petals and woven stems; warm highlights catch petal edges and rope-fibers, violet sheen from outside blooms leaks in as cold rim light, hard shadows pool behind the weave. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: talryn-drops-provisions.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Talryn stepped inside and set a pack on the floor.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn, Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Talryn drops a supply pack with efficient authority; Drusniel and Srietz pack in silence; Elion watches the entrance without blinking. Inside the flower-woven shelter, petals and crushed blooms cover the floor, thick stems form walls with gaps revealing shadowed flowers outside; the air carries a chemical tang. Cold dawn spill slices across leather straps and cloth folds while dim candle-stubs add weak warm points that reflect off damp petal surfaces; highlights bloom softly in haze and shadows stay ink-black between stems. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: march-through-black-flowers.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "They packed in silence and followed Talryn out of the flower-woven structure into a morning that smelled like chemicals and looked like a painting done in shades of black and violet.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn, Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Talryn leads with practiced certainty; Drusniel speaks low to Srietz, hands kept still; Srietz listens tight and quiet; Elion brings up the rear, attention split. Wide tracking view of a narrow path cutting through endless rows of cultivated black-violet flowers, petals angling subtly toward the travelers; chemical haze turns the morning into muted black, violet, and grey. Cold morning daylight through haze flattens the scene while dew on petals throws violet specular sheen onto boots and cloth edges; the rows ahead dissolve into soft blur with haze bloom. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: talryn-sends-a-signal.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Pressed it twice during the morning march.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn]. Spider-still patience at the clearing’s edge, gaze fixed down the path behind; one gloved hand presses a small concealed signaling device inside her belt pouch, no markings readable. Midday halt clearing with fire pit stones, stacked provisions, and a simple water source; the others blurred behind eating in wary silence while flowers rustle at the perimeter like listeners. Hard midday daylight cuts crisp shadows across stone and leather, violet sheen from nearby petals adds cold edge highlights on the pouch seam and glove knuckles; reflections skate across worn leather grain and metal rivets. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: watched-march.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The flowers watched them go.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn, Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Talryn ahead, never looking back; Drusniel heavy thoughtful posture; Srietz close and quiet; Elion at the rear turning to check behind. Closing march from slightly behind at waist height as black flowers line the path and seem to watch, petals tracking their movement in still chemical air. Late-day light filters through haze in a cold grey sheet while dew and petal sheen throw faint violet glints along the corridor edges; shadows pool between rows like ink and reflections break into jagged streaks on wet petals. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, background softened, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
