# Chapter 19.5 | The Dawn

The darkness lifted gradually, not into daylight but into Wyrmreach's perpetual grey-green twilight. Drusniel had been awake for an hour already, watching the sky shift through shades of nothing.

Srietz had packed everything. The goblin's efficiency was nearly mechanical—each item in its precise place, each calculation complete before Drusniel finished his watch.

"Ready?" The word felt inadequate for what they were about to do.

"Ready is a relative term." Srietz shouldered his pack. "Srietz is prepared. Readiness implies confidence. Srietz does not have confidence. Srietz has probability assessments and contingency calculations."

"That's almost philosophy."

"Srietz prefers 'survival methodology.'" The goblin's ears twitched. "But Srietz acknowledges the overlap."

Elion was already moving, his recovery complete enough that he'd taken the final watch and still looked more alert than either of them. The shapeshifter hadn't said much since their conversation the night before—but something in his posture had shifted. Less guarded. More present.

They walked east.

The terrain changed as they moved—volcanic glass giving way to darker stone, then to something that might have been soil if soil could be that color. Black. Grey. Streaked with veins of dull red that pulsed like slow heartbeats in the ground.

And on the horizon, the glow.

Drusniel had seen it before, from the caravan. A distant red, like a wound in the sky. But it was closer now, and the word "distant" no longer applied. The volcanic light painted the clouds—or whatever passed for clouds here—in shades of fire and ash.

"The contested lands," Srietz said quietly.

"Yes."

"The lords' territories."

"Yes."

"Srietz wishes to formally note that walking toward that—" He gestured at the glow. "—contradicts most survival calculations Srietz has ever made."

"But you're walking anyway."

"Srietz is walking anyway." The goblin's voice held something that might have been acceptance. Or resignation. Hard to tell the difference. "Some calculations cannot be made in isolation. Group factors complicate everything."

Elion fell in beside Drusniel. The shapeshifter's eyes were fixed on the horizon, on that distant fire, and his expression was unreadable.

"I've been in Wyrmreach for decades," he said. "I've avoided those lands the entire time. There are stories about what lives there. What happens to travelers who enter without invitation."

"Are we invited?"

"No." A pause. "But we're going anyway."

They reached a ridge—not high, but high enough to see what lay ahead. The contested lands spread before them like a wound in the world. Black flowers carpeted the lower slopes of a volcanic formation that rose against the perpetual twilight. The ground steamed. The air tasted of sulfur and something else—something that reminded Drusniel of the Voice's presence. Of power barely contained.

Three territories. Three lords. And somewhere beyond them, Szoravel.

"We move fast," Drusniel said. "Stay low. Avoid attention where possible."

"And where not possible?" Srietz asked.

"Then we improvise."

It wasn't a plan. Not really. But it was all they had.

Drusniel looked at his companions—the goblin alchemist who'd survived by calculation, the shapeshifter who'd survived by adaptation. Both following him now, into danger he couldn't predict, toward answers he might not find.

"Thank you," he said. The words felt strange. Insufficient.

"Gratitude is premature." Srietz adjusted his pack. "Save thanks for successful survival."

"He means you're welcome." Elion's voice held the ghost of humor. "In his way."

"Srietz meant exactly what Srietz said. But—" The goblin paused. "Srietz does not object to the interpretation."

Drusniel took a breath. Behind them, the gloomy town and its watching eyes. The caves where they'd hidden. The caravan's wreckage. Everything that had brought them to this moment.

Ahead, the contested lands. The volcanic glow. The lords and their servants. And somewhere beyond all of it, Szoravel. Answers. Or traps. Or both.

*The contested lands spread before them. Behind them, nothing worth returning to. So they walked forward, into the fire.*

Direction.

It was all they had. All anyone had, really, when everything else was stripped away.

They walked east, toward the volcanic light, toward danger they couldn't imagine and answers they might not survive long enough to hear.

But they walked together.

That, at least, was something.
