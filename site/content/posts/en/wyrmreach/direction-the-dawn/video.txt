## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow pull back starts at the ridge edge as sulfur wind carries ash grit past the lens; steam vents below exhale in rhythmic bursts and the crystal field begins to hum as footsteps approach.  
[00:03-00:05] The pull back widens to reveal three travelers cresting the lip; they pause for one beat, then Srietz points east and Drusniel answers with a short hand signal to move fast and low.  
[00:05-00:08] The pull back continues as they descend into the black crystals; violet reflections flicker across facets, heat shimmer bends the air over fissures, and their bootsteps crunch like ash while the red horizon glow pulses ahead.

Camera movement: Slow pull back from ridge edge to wide reveal.  
Audio: sulfur wind hiss, ash crunch under boots, distant volcanic rumble, steam venting, faint crystalline hum rising as they pass. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
