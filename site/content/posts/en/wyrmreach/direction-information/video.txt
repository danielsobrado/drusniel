## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow pull back begins on Drusniel’s profile at the cave mouth, breath fogging as slate-violet twilight washes the ash flats beyond; faint Beacon light rims his shoulder from behind.  
[00:03-00:05] The pull back widens to include the cave interior glow—cyan fungi breathing along the walls, the wrapped Beacon humming in the pack, Srietz’s neatly stacked supplies and Elion’s silhouette half-seen.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera settles at the threshold, framing the jagged volcanic horizon and distant red glow of a contested volcano while Drusniel squares his shoulders toward the east.

Camera movement: Slow pull back from profile to threshold.  
Audio: Wind carrying ash grit, distant volcanic rumble, faint Beacon hum, soft fungus drip, fabric rustle as Drusniel adjusts his pack. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles. Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
