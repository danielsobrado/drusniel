1. filename: header.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Listening hard, jaw tight, eyes narrowed. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Sets down sorted supplies, ears angled back, weighing what to say. [Face_Reference: Elion] Half-awake against the cave wall, gaze tracking them. Cramped cave camp with wet volcanic glass, stacked rope and meat piles; a rough map scratched into dust beside them. Beacon wrapped in the pack leaks cold blue-white core while cyan fungi pulse on stone, throwing mixed glows on faces and gear. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: mid-01.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The goblin set down the supplies he'd been sorting.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Finger tracing three rough border lines on a mud-stained parchment map; expression careful, wary to speak. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Watching without blinking, shoulders hunched forward. Supplies lie in precise stacks, damp cave walls close in. Beacon glow from the pack adds thin blue edges to parchment and claws; lantern ember adds warm counterlight, creating color split on their faces. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur at fingertip, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mid-02.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel looked at the artifact in his pack, its phosphorescent pulse steady and visible.")
prompt:Open pack in close-up with the Beacon nested inside cloth, emitting a steady blue-white phosphorescent pulse that stains leather straps and stone. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] At frame edge, jaw clenched, hand hovering to cover it. [Face_Reference: Elion] Eyes watching from shadow behind, wary. Fungal light paints teal across condensation while the Beacon throws hard highlights into folds, creating double shadows. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: mid-03.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The information settled over Drusniel like weight.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Tightens pack straps with resigned focus. [Face_Reference: Elion] Checks gear quietly, eyes hooded. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Arranges small stones and scratched symbols on the ground to mark the safest path, expression calculating. Lantern warmth battles Beacon cold; shadows of stones stretch across ash-dusted floor while cyan fungi wash the cave walls. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: mid-04.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel looked east, toward territories he couldn't see but could almost feel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Profile at the cave mouth, eyes fixed on unseen territories, breath fogging. Outside: black volcanic stone, ash flats, faint heat haze and distant volcanic glow on the horizon. Inside darkness frames him while the hidden Beacon in the pack behind adds a cold rim to his silhouette; twilight beyond is slate and violet. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
