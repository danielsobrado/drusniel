## Chapter 21 | Part 2

--- 

They'd been in the crystal field for two hours when the arrows came.

No warning. No shout. One moment they were walking the narrow path between walls of black crystal spires, and the next the air filled with the hiss of feathered shafts cutting through the charged air.

Elion moved first. He grabbed Srietz by the collar and threw them both sideways between the crystal formations. Drusniel felt the displacement of air as a shaft passed his ear close enough to tug his hair.

Instinct fired before thought.

His hands came up and magic followed, raw and unshapen, a burst of air that exploded outward from his palms. The remaining arrows caught the blast and scattered, spinning wildly, embedding themselves in soil and crystal bases instead of flesh.

The silence after was worse than the arrows.

Drusniel stood in the path with his hands raised, magic crackling along his fingers, the air around him disturbed and swirling with crystal dust. His heart hammered. His vision narrowed. He could feel the spell still buzzing at his fingertips, hungry for more, and he clenched his fists to kill it.

Too late.

They emerged from between the crystals like they'd been part of the formation. Thirty, maybe forty figures in armor the color of wet earth, faces covered, weapons drawn. They surrounded the group in seconds, materializing from the crystal field as if the stone had birthed them.

*"Hold."*

A single voice, clear and commanding, cut through the scramble. The scouts froze mid-motion. Every weapon stayed where it was, pointed inward at Drusniel and his companions, but nothing moved.

The voice spoke again, closer this time. Calm. Almost amused.

"That one just moved the wind."

A figure stepped through the ring of scouts. Taller than the others, wearing the same earth-colored armor but with a cloak that shifted like water in low light. Their face was uncovered: sharp features, dark skin, eyes that assessed everything and yielded nothing.

The figure looked at Drusniel's hands. At the scattered arrows buried in the soil. At the crystal dust still drifting in the disturbed air.

"A drow with air magic." The figure's head tilted. "How unusual."

Drusniel's mind was still catching up with his body. The panic-cast had been involuntary, pure survival instinct, and now every scout in the field had seen it. In the contested lands, where multiple factions tracked every magical signature, he might as well have lit a bonfire.

"Drop your hands," Elion whispered from somewhere among the crystals. "Slowly."

Drusniel lowered his hands.

The figure in the cloak studied him the way a collector studies an unexpected find. Not with hunger. With interest. The distinction was thin but real.

"Bring them," the figure said. "All of them. Alive."

The scouts moved. Efficient, practiced. Srietz was pulled from between the crystal formations, his pack confiscated, his protests ignored. Elion emerged with his arms raised, face carefully blank. Drusniel felt rough hands on his shoulders, turning him, binding his wrists with cord that hummed faintly against his skin.

"My scouts mistook you for a rival lord's agents," the figure said, walking alongside Drusniel as they were marched deeper into the field. "An honest error. We've had three incursions this month. The lord of these lands is particular about uninvited guests."

"We're not agents."

"No. Agents don't panic-cast air magic in the middle of a crystal field." A thin smile. "Agents are trained. You, young drow, reacted on instinct. Which means you're either very new to this or very old at something else."

Drusniel said nothing. The cord bit into his wrists.

"My name is Varesh. I serve Lady Nyxara, whose territory you are currently trespassing through." Varesh's tone was conversational, friendly even, in the way a blade could be friendly if held at the right angle. "The arrows were a mistake. The capture is not. You understand the difference."

"We're passing through," Drusniel said. "We don't intend to stay."

"Intentions are irrelevant in the contested lands. Presence is what matters. You're present. So you belong to whoever finds you first." Varesh gestured ahead. "Fortunately for you, Lady Nyxara prefers conversation to execution. Most of the time."

They walked deeper into the crystal field. The path widened, then widened again, and the rows of black spires grew taller and more regimented until they formed corridors, then walls, then something that looked like the approach to a palace made entirely of cultivated darkness.

Drusniel's eyes traced the fracture patterns in the crystal walls. His grounding habit seized on them greedily. Every formation was veined with hairline cracks, every surface a map of stress and growth. Too many to follow. Too intricate to read. Arranged with terrifying precision by someone who understood that control was more impressive than force.

Srietz walked beside him, ears flat, calculations running behind his eyes.

"Three exits visible," the goblin murmured. "All guarded. Force assessment: unfavorable. Srietz recommends compliance until strategic variables change."

"I wasn't planning to fight."

"Srietz notes the air spell suggests otherwise."

That was fair.

Ahead, the crystal corridor opened into a clearing. The ground was bare black soil, packed hard, surrounded by crystal spires that stood at full height, six feet or more, facets angled inward like an audience watching a stage. At the center of the clearing, someone had set a table.

Three chairs. Three cups, still steaming.

Srietz's breath caught. "She knows," he whispered. "She knows exactly how many we are."

Drusniel looked at the table. At the three cups. At the empty chairs arranged with the casual precision of someone who had been expecting them not for hours but for days.

The crystals hummed, a harmonic that rose through the soles of his feet and settled behind his teeth.

Lady Nyxara was coming.
