1. filename: arrows-in-the-crystal-field.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Reflex shock, hands snapped up; air-magic detonating outward from his palms. Narrow corridor between dense faceted black crystal walls as a sudden volley of arrows slices through chemical haze and the gust bends shafts off-course; crystal dust and grit spiral in a pressure ring. Violet refraction glints on shard edges while orange fissure-glow from below lights the dust storm and catches arrow fletching in brief specular flashes, scattering highlights across wet-black facets. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, motion blur on arrows, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: arrow-passes-his-ear.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel felt the displacement of air as a shaft passed his ear close enough to tug his hair.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Pupils tight, shock mid-breath; sweat and stinging tears mixed with grit, a hair strand yanked by the passing shaft. Tight portrait as an arrow whistles past his ear, fletching smeared into a streak; suspended crystal powder floats like glittering grit in shallow focus while the black crystal corridor dissolves into bokeh behind. Violet refraction catches inside dust motes and low orange underglow from hairline cracks paints the underside of jaw and ear, turning drifting particles into tiny amber points. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: armored-observers-emerge.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "They emerged from between the crystals like they'd been part of the formation.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Drusniel half-raised hands, spell residue; Srietz pinned low after the throw; Elion protective posture, arms up. Dozens of scouts in earth-colored armor with covered faces step out from between crystal spires as if the field birthed them, weapons drawn, ring tightening on the narrow path; arrows stick in soil and crystal bases and dust still swirls in charged air. Violet refraction draws cold edge highlights along armor plates while orange fissure-light at their feet turns dust into floating ember-specks; reflections skate across surrounding facets in jagged streaks. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, background softened, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: varesh-steps-forward.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A figure stepped through the ring of scouts.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varesh, Drusniel]. Varesh calm interest, thin smile starting; Drusniel lowering hands slowly, wrists bound in humming cord. Varesh steps through the frozen ring of scouts, studying scattered arrows and drifting crystal dust while weapons remain trained inward; cloak shifts like water in low light. Orange fissure-glow paints warm undersides and the cord’s fibers catch amber highlights; violet refraction from crystal walls casts cool bands across the cloak’s sheen, haze blooming edges into soft halation. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: table-set-for-three.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Three chairs. Three cups, still steaming.")
prompt:Plain table set for three in a circular clearing of packed black soil, three empty chairs and three steaming cups at the center while towering inward-leaning faceted crystal spires surround like an audience. Steam twists in chemical air, catching light as the crystal hum feels like pressure behind teeth; the corridor opens into silence. Cold violet luminescence refracts through the crystal walls and throws thin prismatic edge highlights; faint orange underglow from hairline cracks warms the lower steam plumes, reflections skating across glassy facets in jagged streaks. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight vignette, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
