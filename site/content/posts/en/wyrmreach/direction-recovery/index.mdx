## Chapter 19 | Part 1

--- 

Three days.

Drusniel had counted every hour. Seventy-two of them, each marked by the slow pulse of bioluminescent fungus on the cave walls, by the rasp of Elion's breathing as he slept, by Srietz's muttered calculations as he inventoried their supplies for the fourth time.

Routine had emerged. Not comfort—Wyrmreach didn't allow comfort—but rhythm. A foothold, however thin, in a place where nothing was stable.

"Elion's color is better." Drusniel didn't frame it as a question. He'd learned that Srietz responded better to observations than queries.

"Srietz agrees. Yesterday: grey. Today: pale. Tomorrow, perhaps, something approaching normal." The goblin's long fingers sorted dried meat into precise piles. "Two more days. Maybe less. Then he walks, and we leave."

"Forty-eight hours." Drusniel looked toward the cave entrance, where perpetual twilight pressed against volcanic glass. "We've been here too long already."

"Srietz notes the impatience. Srietz also notes the wisdom of waiting. A recovered scout is more valuable than a dead one."

Elion stirred, eyes flickering open. The shapeshifter still looked wrong—gaunt, hollow, like something that had been emptied out and was slowly refilling. But his gaze was clear. Present.

"You're discussing me."

"We're discussing departure." Drusniel moved closer. "Can you travel?"

"Not yet." Elion's voice was raspy. "Another day. Maybe two. The transformation—" He stopped, seemed to search for words. "It's like being turned inside out and having to remember which parts go where. The body knows, eventually. But it takes time."

"We don't have time."

"Then leave me." No bitterness in the words. Just fact. "I'll catch up when I can. If I can."

"That's not happening."

Elion's eyes met his. Something passed between them—not understanding exactly, but recognition. An acknowledgment of debts neither would name.

"Then we wait," Elion said. "And you tell me where we're going while we do."

Drusniel hesitated. He'd been avoiding this conversation, putting it off until necessity forced his hand. But necessity was here now, pressing against the cave walls with all the weight of Wyrmreach's endless dark.

"Szoravel." The name felt strange on his tongue. "A drow mage. Someone who might have answers."

"Might?"

"The information came from—" Drusniel stopped. How to explain Zaelar? How to describe that moment of impossible connection, the instructions that felt more like compulsion than communication? "From someone who claimed to know things. Someone I have no reason to trust."

"And yet you're going."

"I don't have other options."

Srietz looked up from his inventory. "Srietz knows of Szoravel. By reputation only. The drow mage has... protection. Powerful protection. Srietz does not know what kind."

"Protected." Drusniel let the word sit. It should have been comforting. It wasn't. "What else do you know?"

"That Szoravel is east. That the eastern territories are contested. That traveling there requires passing through lands where three lords fight for dominance." Srietz's voice was flat, clinical. "Srietz survived by avoiding those lands. Srietz did not ask questions about what ruled them."

"But you survived."

"Srietz calculates probabilities. Srietz knew which routes were less likely to result in death. Less likely is not unlikely." The goblin's ears twitched. "With three companions, probabilities shift. Unpredictably."

Elion had closed his eyes again, but Drusniel could tell he wasn't sleeping. Just listening. Processing.

"When you're ready," Drusniel said, "we move east. Toward Szoravel. Toward whatever answers wait there."

"And if the answers aren't what you want?"

"Then at least they'll be answers."

He moved to the cave entrance, looking out at the perpetual twilight. Somewhere beyond this volcanic glass maze, a drow mage waited. Someone who might explain what the Voice wanted, what the Beacon meant, why Drusniel was still alive when so many others weren't.

*Szoravel. The name Zaelar gave him. The destination that felt more like a trap every time he thought about it.*

Behind him, Srietz continued counting. Elion continued healing. And the Beacon continued pointing, its phosphorescent glow steady and patient, leading them toward something none of them understood.

Direction, at least. Direction was something.
