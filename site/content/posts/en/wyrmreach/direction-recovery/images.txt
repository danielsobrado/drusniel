1. filename: three-days-in-the-cave.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Awake, blue-ash skin drawn tight, eyes fixed on the slow pulse of time. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Bent over supplies, lips counting, long fingers precise. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Asleep but color returning, breathing steadier. They share a low cave hollow lined with wet volcanic glass; the Beacon stays wrapped in Drusniel’s pack, leaking a cold blue-white core while bioluminescent fungi beat soft cyan along the walls. Light mixes—Beacon glow casting hard-edged highlights on metal buckles, fungal pulse breathing cool halos into condensation; shadows ripple on stone ceiling. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: bioluminescent-fungi-hour-markers.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel had counted every hour.")
prompt:Close macro on clustered bioluminescent fungi used as hour marks; caps slick with moisture, each pulse sending cyan light across wet obsidian streaks. Minute condensation beads catch and refract the glow, rippling like a heartbeat; scratch tally marks on nearby stone record the hours. Light is entirely from the fungi, bouncing teal highlights along droplets and casting soft green shadows. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: elion-awakens-gaunt.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Elion stirred, eyes flickering open.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Gaunt but present, eyes finally clear, propping himself up on one elbow. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Leaned close, urgency in his stare, jaw set. Rough bedding on cooled volcanic sand inside the cave; Beacon glow hidden in the pack throws cold blue on Elion’s cheekbones while cyan fungus light crosshatches the shadows. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: srietz-inventories-again.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The goblin's long fingers sorted dried meat into precise piles.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Crouched low, long fingers arranging dried meat into identical stacks, ears angled in concentration; expression clinical, counting aloud. Beside him lie a hand-sketched route and marked stones. Beacon light from the pack casts a thin blue edge on knuckles while the fungi bathe the supplies in shifting cyan, making salt crystals sparkle. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur at fingertips, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: direction-to-the-east.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He moved to the cave entrance, looking out at the perpetual twilight.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Standing at the cave mouth, shoulders squared toward the eastern haze; eyes narrowed, breath fogging in the cold. Outside lies Wyrmreach’s perpetual twilight over jagged volcanic crystal and ash plains; inside, the pack’s hidden Beacon glows steady behind him like a pointer. Cyan from distant fungi fades near the entrance while the Beacon adds a cool rim to his profile; twilight beyond is slate and violet with no direct sun. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
