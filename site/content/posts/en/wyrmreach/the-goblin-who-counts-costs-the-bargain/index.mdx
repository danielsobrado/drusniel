## Chapter 15 | Part 4

---

They stopped in a cavern where something else lived.

Drusniel could feel it—a presence in the stone, watching them with curiosity rather than hunger. Whatever called this place home was large enough to make the Coatly avoid it. That should have been terrifying. Instead, it felt like safety.

"Rest." Srietz collapsed against a wall, breathing hard. "The things that live here don't like Vexrath's creatures. Something about territory. We're safe until dawn. After that—" he shrugged "—we move again."

Elion settled into a crouch that somehow suggested both relaxation and readiness. Drusniel remained standing, watching the goblin with calculating eyes.

"You led us well," he admitted. "You know this territory."

"Srietz knows survival. Survival requires knowing." The goblin's eyes gleamed in the darkness. "Srietz also knows that survival alone is hard. Survival with allies is better. You are potential allies."

"Potential."

"Srietz does not trust easily. Trust must be earned. You do not trust easily either—Srietz can see this in how you move, how you watch, how you count things that do not need counting." A flash of teeth, too sharp to be friendly. "But we can be useful to each other without trust. That is better business anyway."

"What do you want?" Elion asked from his crouch.

"To leave Vexrath's territory. To find somewhere far away where Srietz can work without masters. To never be property again." The words came fast, practiced, honest. "What do you want?"

"To reach a mage named Szoravel," Drusniel said. "East, past the disputed lands."

"Szoravel." Srietz tilted his head. "Srietz knows of him. Mad hermit in the waste. Powerful. Dangerous. Also possibly dead—no one has confirmed life in years." He paused. "But the path east passes through many territories. Srietz knows some of them. Srietz could guide."

"In exchange for?"

"Protection. Until we clear Vexrath's reach. After that—" the goblin's hands spread wide "—we renegotiate. Fair trade. Clean trade. Everyone knows the terms."

Drusniel considered. The goblin was self-interested—that was obvious. But self-interest was predictable. A creature focused on survival wouldn't betray useful allies.

"Srietz remembers who pays fair," the goblin added quietly. "Srietz also remembers who doesn't."

"We have a deal," Drusniel said.

Srietz's grin widened. "Then we are partners. Temporary. Conditional. But partners." He settled back against the stone. "Now sleep. Dawn comes whether we're ready or not."
