1. filename: cave-safe-until-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, wary relief; Srietz collapses against the wall breathing hard, Elion settles into a crouch that reads both rest and readiness, and Drusniel remains standing with a listening stillness as if the stone itself is speaking. They shelter in a cavern that feels inhabited by something large and curious rather than hungry; the air holds a presence that keeps the Coatly away, turning terror into a strange, temporary safety. Faint violet mineral luminescence from seams in the volcanic stone provides cold low fill that reveals wet rock texture and drifting dust, while a thin pre-dawn grey leak from a high fissure outlines shoulders and makes the far chamber fall away into layered black. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation in the violet glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: srietz-says-rest.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "We're safe until dawn.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Photorealistic, exhausted control; slumped against cold stone with breath still ragged, forcing calm as he says they are safe until dawn, ears angled to listen for threats that stop at this cavern's edge. Tight portrait with damp volcanic rock behind him, grit stuck to his sleeves and fingers, and a faint tremor in his hands that he pretends isn't there. Violet mineral glow from the wall seams gives cold fill from below, catching moisture on skin and turning wet stone into glossy highlights, while the faintest pre-dawn grey from the fissure behind adds a thin rim along his cheek and ear. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drusniel-calculates-the-bargain.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel remained standing, watching the goblin with calculating eyes.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Photorealistic, calculating eyes and refusal to relax; dust and grit from the run still clinging, breath controlled as he weighs a bargain the way he weighs distance and risk. He stands over Srietz in the cave's hush, listening past words to the presence in the stone; the quiet feels like a contract with something unseen that neither side is naming. Cold violet luminescence from mineral seams lifts detail from below and catches on wet rock texture, while the thin pre-dawn leak from a high fissure gives a weak rim that separates his silhouette from the black depth behind. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: elion-listens-to-terms.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Elion settled into a crouch that somehow suggested both relaxation and readiness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Photorealistic, guarded practicality; crouched low in a posture that reads both rest and readiness, eyes tracking every term and every shift of Srietz's hands. The cave floor around him is uneven and damp, grit and small stone chips pressed into the ground where they stopped; the air feels watched but not threatened, as if the cavern is tolerating them. Violet mineral glow pools low and cold across the rock and picks out moisture on skin and fabric edges, while the faint pre-dawn rim from the fissure behind cuts a thin line along his shoulder and knee. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: we-have-a-deal.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The math was simple.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, terms accepted without warmth; Drusniel gives a small final nod, Srietz's mouth pulls into a quick sharp smile of good business, and Elion watches from his crouch without blinking. The bargain locks in inside the cavern's temporary safety, stone damp and close around them, the outside shrieks now distant and muffled; dawn is a deadline implied by the thin grey line at the high fissure slowly brightening. Violet mineral luminescence provides cold fill that catches on wet rock and turns dust motes into faint points, while the growing pre-dawn leak adds a pale rim that separates faces from the cave dark. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
