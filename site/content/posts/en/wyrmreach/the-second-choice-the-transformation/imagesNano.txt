1. filename: elion-steps-into-the-center.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Shoulders squared, pallor worse, hands trembling but held still; he measures the cost. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Guarded worry, jaw tight, stance anchored against the wall. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Recoiled, lips parted, eyes fixed, fingers worrying at cloth. Elion steps into the center and asks for space in a cramped obsidian cave; wet black-glass walls sweat condensation and breath fog hangs low. Ceiling cyan-green phosphorescence emits weak top-light that skims wet stone facets, catching undersides of brows and cheekbones; a faint blue-white Beacon pulse leaks through fabric and bounces as tiny specular points across droplets and the glossy obsidian floor. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: transformation-begins.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The first sound was a crack—bone, unmistakably.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Eyes squeezed shut, brow knotted, teeth set; sweat beads. He takes the first cracking bend, shoulders jerking and spine bowing under skin that ripples as the body rebuilds from within. Wet obsidian reflections crowd the frame, condensation beading on black glass like pinpoints. Ceiling phosphorescence throws cold cyan-green top-light that creates sharp specular highlights on sweat and wet stone; a brief Beacon pulse adds a blue-white edge that catches the curve of jaw and nearest droplets before falling off into black. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-forces-himself-to-watch.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel forced himself to watch.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Unblinking stare, nostrils flared, jaw locked; hand half raised then forced down. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Staggering back, hands clamped over ears, eyes wide and wet, shoulders hunched. Drusniel watches from the wall as the cave center writhes out of focus, silhouette elongating in nauseating increments; Srietz scrapes a heel on slick stone, breath stuttering. The ceiling glow pulses unevenly, cyan reflections fractured in wet obsidian; a Beacon glint bounces as thin blue-white rim light along fingers and eyelids while shadows stay cool and dense. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in the background, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: built-for-speed.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The creature in the center of the cave was built for speed—long, low, angles designed for running rather than fighting.")
prompt:Low long creature coiled for sprinting in the center of the obsidian cave, sinewy and efficient, eyes holding a trace of recognition before it launches into darkness, limbs smearing with speed. Wet black-glass walls and floor mirror the movement in fractured reflections, condensation droplets kicked into small arcs. Ceiling cyan-green phosphorescence skims along wet muscle and glossy stone, producing razor specular streaks; movement creates strobing shadows that ripple across the cave like broken shutters. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur, subtle vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: the-cave-feels-empty.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The cave felt emptier without Elion.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Hollow-eyed, shoulders heavy, counting under his breath, stare fixed on the empty center. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Rigid in his corner, lips pressed, refusing to look where Elion stood. After the sprint, they sit apart in the obsidian cave and measure time by slow phosphorescent pulses, listening to water ticks and distant stone. Cyan ceiling glow falls soft and top-down, turning puddles into dim mirrors and painting gentle highlights on slack hands; occasional blue-white reflections flicker off wet facets like brief ghosts. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
