1. filename: ribcage-settlement-establishing.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes flicking from arch to alley, expression tight with calculation. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Hunched forward, scanning for threats, grip firm on his gem pouch. [Face_Reference: Elion] Walking again, steadier than before, but his gaze still shadowed. Wide view of a settlement grown inside the ribcage of a colossal dead creature: cathedral bone arches rise overhead while ramshackle shacks and rope walkways cling to ribs like parasites; ash-dark ground and sulfur haze swirl around the trio as they approach. Distant volcanic glow and scattered brazier fires within the ribcage push warm orange points into grey twilight, smoke smearing the light through the haze. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: entering-bone-alleys.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel counted exits as they entered.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes darting left-right, breath controlled, posture rigid with threat-mapping. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Tight-shouldered and guarded, watching corners, ready to bolt. [Face_Reference: Elion] Steady stride, but his eyes still hold tired shadows. They pass beneath bone arches into narrow alleys of scrap-wood stalls and rope bridges; smoke, sweat, rot, and sulfur hang in the air as poorly hidden weapons and too-many eyes track them from the dark. Torch and brazier light pools warm under the ribs while cold twilight leaks through gaps above, striping faces with alternating amber and grey. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: srietz-trades-gems.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Srietz found his trader in a stall that smelled of preserved meat and something chemical.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Hands precise as he slides two gems forward; expression cautious, transactional. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Close at his shoulder, gaze hard, scanning the watching crowd. [Face_Reference: Elion] Half-turned to cover their back, alert to movement. A market stall under bone shadows; a blurred, altered merchant produces a small lens and inspects the gems while hidden compartments sit half-concealed in stained wood and hanging tarps. Gem-glow throws sharp blue-white highlights on fingertips and glass while a smoky oil lamp adds warm spill that catches on wet rib-bone and greasy stall surfaces. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, subtle lens flare off the lens glass, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: provisions-from-hidden-compartments.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "They began pulling items from hidden compartments: dried rations, water purification tablets, a thin rope that looked stronger than it should.")
prompt:Close macro on supplies laid out on stained wood: dried rations, water purification tablets, and a thin cord coiled tight, its fibers unnaturally clean against the grime; a hidden panel sits ajar, metal clasps worn smooth. Gem light and a guttering stall-lamp create mixed highlights on foil packets and frayed rope ends, reflections skating across damp wood while the background falls into soft, watchful blur. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: leave-ribcage-town-east.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "They left quickly after that.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Urgent stride, one hand locked on his pack strap, eyes forward, refusing to look back. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Walking fast, shoulders hunched, supplies clutched tight. [Face_Reference: Elion] Flanking them, scanning over his shoulder once before facing east again. They push out past crude gates into ash flats; behind them the massive rib arches loom dark against Wyrmreach's grey sky, and the town's shadowed alleys feel crowded with unseen attention. Warm torchlight and brazier smoke from within the ribs fades behind them while distant volcanic glow and cold twilight flatten the world ahead. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
