1. filename: nyxara-enters-the-clearing.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Srietz, Elion, Nyxara]. Drusniel guarded stillness; Srietz ears pinned, breath counted; Elion arms crossed, cataloging exits; Nyxara approaches unhurried in an ink-dark dress with no visible weapons. Circular clearing of compacted black soil surrounded by inward-leaning faceted crystal spires like a silent audience; a plain table set for three with three steaming cups as the crystal walls grind and rotate to open a corridor for her entrance. Violet luminescence refracts inside the crystal lattice and throws thin caustic edge highlights across cup rims and cheekbones, while orange fissure-glow from hairline cracks uplights hands and steam plumes; drifting chemical haze blooms both colors into soft halation on wet-black facets. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight handheld tension, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: untouched-tea-cups.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel didn't touch his.")
prompt:Three dark ceramic cups on a worn tabletop, clear mineral tea steaming in thin twisting threads; one slender hand hovers near the nearest cup and refuses to touch, crystal dust packed into hairline scratches and grooves. Out-of-focus black crystal spires loom behind like a wall, the hum implied by micro-vibration rippling the steam. Violet refraction paints cold edge highlights along cup rims and steam strands, while low orange underglow from hairline cracks catches the underside of the vapor and turns drifting dust into tiny amber points; wet grit reflects pinprick speculars. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM macro Kodak Ektar 100, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: crystals-open-a-corridor.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The crystals shifted.")
prompt:A slow mechanical wave travels through the black crystal wall as individual faceted spires grind and rotate on their bases, carving a deliberate corridor of bare stone into the clearing; fine grit rains from facets, no wind at all, only deliberate motion. Violet refraction shifts along edges like a moving seam, and orange fissure-glow leaks up from hairline cracks to uplight falling grit so each grain flashes amber before vanishing into shadow; specular streaks skate across glassy facets as they turn. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in falling dust, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: nyxara-obsidian-portrait.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "She sat in the empty chair at the head of the table, arranged her hands in her lap, and looked at Drusniel with eyes that were very dark and very still.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Nyxara]. Eyes perfectly still, calm interest without warmth; hands arranged in lap, ink-dark dress absorbing light, posture claiming space without effort. Portrait at the head of the table with inward-leaning crystal spires surrounding like an audience, steaming cups falling into foreground bokeh, chemical air hanging heavy. Violet refraction bends toward her and outlines her silhouette, while faint orange underglow from hairline cracks adds subtle uplight under chin and fingers; edge highlights bloom into soft halation along crystal facets and ceramic glaze. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: nyxara-and-drusniel-conversation.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "\"What do you want?\" he asked.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Nyxara]. Drusniel jaw set, breath controlled, fingers forced still; Nyxara steady gaze, thin smile that never reaches her eyes. Tense two-shot across the plain table with untouched tea steaming between them, crystal walls looming close like a congregation listening; behind Nyxara the crystal field pulses once with deeper violet, then settles. Violet refraction carves sharp edge highlights across facets and cup rims while low orange fissure-glow warms the underside of steam plumes, mixed light scattering through haze into soft bloom; reflections skate in jagged streaks across wet-black crystal faces. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
