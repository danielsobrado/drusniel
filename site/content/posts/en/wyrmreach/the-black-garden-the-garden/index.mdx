## Chapter 21 | Part 3

--- 

They waited.

Varesh had cut their bonds and gestured toward the chairs with the casual authority of someone who understood that the real cage was the territory itself. Drusniel sat. Srietz sat. Elion stood behind them, arms crossed, watching the crystal walls with the focused attention of someone cataloging exits.

The cups were ceramic, dark, finely made. The liquid inside was clear and smelled faintly mineral, like water filtered through volcanic stone. Drusniel didn't touch his.

"Srietz recommends against consumption," the goblin said, eyeing his cup. "Resonance profile of the black crystals suggests at least fourteen aerosolized compounds in this vicinity with psychoactive properties. At least three are paralytic in concentrated form. This liquid has been in proximity long enough to absorb trace elements."

"It's tea," Varesh said from the edge of the clearing. "Just tea."

"Srietz has been poisoned by 'just tea' on four separate occasions."

Varesh almost smiled. "Fair point."

The crystals shifted.

Not with wind. There was no wind. The formations tilted, a wave of motion traveling from the edge of the clearing inward, spires rotating on their bases to create a corridor of bare stone. The movement was slow, grinding, and completely deliberate.

Nyxara entered through the gap the crystals made for her.

Drusniel had expected armor. Weapons. The trappings of a warlord who held territory in the most dangerous region of Wyrmreach. What he saw was a woman of middling height in a dress the color of wet ink, her hair swept back from a face that held the quality of carved obsidian. Beautiful, but beautiful the way a blade was beautiful. Not for comfort. For function.

She moved without hurry. Each step placed with the consideration of someone who knew exactly how much space she occupied and chose to occupy exactly that much. No guards flanked her. No weapons visible. She didn't need them. The crystals hummed as she passed, their resonance shifting to a warmer frequency, facets catching light and bending it toward her like a congregation turning to face its priest.

The crystals were hers. The land was hers. The air they breathed was hers.

She sat in the empty chair at the head of the table, arranged her hands in her lap, and looked at Drusniel with eyes that were very dark and very still.

"You're younger than I expected," she said. Her voice was low, controlled, the kind of voice that never needed to be raised because it was always heard. "When my scouts reported a drow with air affinity traveling through the contested lands, I imagined someone older. More weathered."

"You were expecting us."

"I was expecting someone. The volcanic shelf has been loud for weeks. Energy moving through old channels, waking things that prefer to sleep. And then three travelers descended from the ridge into my fields, and one of them threw my arrows aside with a thought." She picked up her cup and drank. "I don't get many drow in my territory. Almost none with your particular talent."

"We're passing through," Drusniel said. "We have business with Szoravel, beyond the contested lands."

"Szoravel." Something flickered across her face. Not surprise. Recognition. "The mage who sits between the cracks. Everyone who comes through my territory is going to Szoravel or running from him." She set the cup down. "Which are you?"

"Going to."

"Then you'll need to survive the journey." She turned her attention to Srietz. "You. Goblin. You know these lands."

Srietz's ears flattened further. "Srietz has... familiarity."

"More than familiarity. You knew to take the central path through my fields. You knew Vorthrak's territory would be hostile. You've been here before."

Srietz said nothing.

Nyxara's gaze moved to Elion, standing behind them. She studied him the way someone studies a knot they haven't decided to untie.

"And you. You're interesting." She didn't elaborate. She didn't need to. Drusniel caught Elion's jaw tighten, the only tell the shapeshifter allowed himself.

"My scouts made an error," Nyxara continued, turning back to Drusniel. "The arrows were not authorized. I prefer to meet travelers before deciding what to do with them. The contested lands are... contentious. Three lords, three philosophies. Vorthrak takes what he wants by force. Sytherix poisons what he can't take. I prefer a different approach."

"Which is?"

"Investment." She smiled. The expression didn't reach her eyes. "I invest in people. Their talents. Their potential. In exchange, they invest their efforts in my interests. A mutual arrangement."

"And if the arrangement isn't mutual?"

"Then we discuss alternatives. But the alternatives in the contested lands tend to be limited." She gestured at the crystal field surrounding them. "My territory is the only safe passage to Szoravel. Vorthrak controls the north. Sytherix controls the south. I control the center. You've already chosen your path. The question is whether you walk it as guests or as trespassers."

The distinction, Drusniel understood, was the difference between breathing tomorrow and not.

"What do you want?" he asked.

Nyxara leaned back in her chair. The crystals behind her pulsed once, a deep violet flare, though nothing else had changed.

"A conversation," she said. "Sit. Drink. Let's discuss what brought a drow with air magic to the worst place in Wyrmreach, and what I might do about it."
