1. filename: deeper-passage-while-they-sleep.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Gaunt from hunger, sleepless eyes; breath controlled, steps measured while walking alone deeper into branching obsidian corridors, counting distance under his breath and memorizing turns. Black-glass walls with wet condensation films and sharp fractured facets, branching junctions fading into darkness, reflections duplicating him in broken strips. Cold cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence skims wet obsidian, producing razor specular streaks and long falloff into black; occasional blue-white Beacon pulses add brief hard glints that jump along corridor edges and reflect as tiny icy points in moisture. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: counting-five-hundred-steps.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He counted his steps automatically—two hundred, three hundred, four hundred—tracking distance against his limited ability to retrace the path.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Lips barely moving, eyes locked ahead; tension in jaw as he counts while mid-stride, turning his head to mark junctions. Tight tunnel framing with obsidian facets and wet streaks, reflections duplicating him in jagged bands. Ceiling phosphorescence creates cold rim highlights on crystal edges and hard specular points on moisture; Beacon pulses add intermittent blue-white catchlights in the eyes and tiny icy glints on wet stone, with shadows staying dense and cool. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: the-voice-chooses-this-moment.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "At five hundred steps, the voice came.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Freeze response, eyes widened then narrowed; head slightly turned as if listening inward, breath held. He stops in a deeper passage as the corridor behind collapses into black, wet obsidian surfaces reflecting thin bands of light. Cold phosphorescence draws a narrow halo on shoulders and cheek edge and creates sharp specular streaks on wet crystal facets; a Beacon pulse throws brief blue-white highlights that make reflections twitch across the wall, then vanish back into darkness. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: knowledge-like-a-migraine.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The information arrived like a migraine—sudden, invasive, impossible to ignore.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes squeezed shut, jaw clenched; hands clawing at temple as pain spikes, then shaking as he drops to his knees. Wet obsidian corridor with sharp crystal facets and condensation streaks, reflections compressing the space around him. Ceiling phosphorescence and wet-stone reflections create harsh cold highlights on sweat and knuckles; a stronger Beacon pulse flashes blue-white across nearby facets, scattering specular glints and turning shadow edges icy for a beat before fading. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in hands, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: two-debts-now.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He stood, oriented himself toward the return path, and began the five-hundred-step walk back to tell the others what he'd learned—and only some of how he'd learned it.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Grim acceptance, eyes steady; one hand briefly pressed to sternum before dropping as he turns and starts the long walk back, counting again. The corridor ahead and behind looks identical, indifferent, obsidian edges catching thin lines of light. Cold phosphorescence stretches narrow highlights along crystal edges and leaves the rest in black; Beacon pulses add intermittent blue-white glints that travel with him like a metronome, reflecting as tiny icy points in moisture films and on metal edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
