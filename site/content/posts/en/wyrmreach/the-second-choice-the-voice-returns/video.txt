## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel walks in the dark with lips barely moving, counting under his breath; he touches the obsidian wall to mark a junction, then stops hard as the Beacon pulse flares against his chest.
[00:03-00:05] He staggers a half step, eyes widening, and jerks a hand to his temple as if struck; the blue-white glow flashes across wet stone, reflections jumping like broken mirrors.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel drops to his knees, breath ragged, forcing himself not to scream; after a beat he swallows, steadies on one palm, and turns his head back toward the return path as the pulse settles.

Handheld.
Audio: boot scuff on obsidian, damp cloth scrape, sharp inhale, water drips, faint low hum from the Beacon, distant rock tick, strained breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
