## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow push-in begins at the hollow entrance as Elion turns in profile against the red horizon glow; Drusniel doesn't step back, only tightens his posture, watching every movement.  
[00:03-00:05] The push-in continues; Srietz slides into the edge of the frame and quietly starts reciting watch times while he straightens supplies into perfect rows, as if order could hold the night in place.  
[00:05-00:08] The camera settles close as the lantern gutter flares once, throwing amber light across damp basalt and tense faces; the red smear on the horizon pulses, and Drusniel closes his eyes for a single breath before opening them again.

Camera movement: Slow push-in at the hollow entrance.  
Audio: low volcanic rumble in the distance, wind over hot stone, lantern wick sputter, soft counting under breath, cloth rustle, ash grit tapping basalt. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.  
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
