# Chapter 19.4 | The Night

They made camp far from the gloomy town, in a hollow between volcanic formations that offered concealment if not comfort. The perpetual twilight had deepened into something approaching true darkness—Wyrmreach's closest approximation to night.

"Watch rotation." Srietz's voice was business-like as he laid out the supplies. "Three hours each. Elion first, then Srietz, then—" He paused, looking at Drusniel. "Then Drusniel. If acceptable."

It was the first time Srietz had used Elion's name without hesitation. No "demon," no qualifiers. Just recognition of the shapeshifter as part of the group.

Drusniel noted it. So did Elion, judging by the slight shift in his expression.

"Acceptable," Drusniel said.

They settled into positions—Elion at the hollow's edge, watching the darkness; Srietz arranging their packs with obsessive precision; Drusniel sitting with his back against warm stone, trying to find something like rest.

Sleep didn't come. Instead, his mind circled the same questions it had been circling for days. Szoravel. Zaelar. The Voice. The Beacon. All of it connected in ways he couldn't see clearly, leading him somewhere he didn't understand.

"You're thinking loudly."

Elion's voice came from the darkness, quiet enough that it wouldn't carry. Drusniel looked up. The shapeshifter had turned slightly, profile visible against the dim volcanic glow.

"Is that something you can actually hear?"

"No." A pause. "But I've learned to read tension. Yours has been building since we left the caves."

"We're walking into contested territory. Toward a mage I've never met. Following instructions from—" Drusniel stopped. "I don't even know what Zaelar is. Was. I don't know if anything it told me was true."

"Does that change the direction?"

"No."

"Then what difference does truth make?"

Drusniel considered the question. "It changes whether I'm walking into a trap or toward answers."

"Does it?" Elion shifted, finding a more comfortable position. "You're still walking. The destination is still the same. Whether it's a trap or answers—" He shrugged, the motion barely visible. "You'll find out when you arrive. Worrying changes nothing."

"That's surprisingly philosophical."

"I've had time to think. Recovery does that." Elion's voice held no irony. "When your body won't move, your mind has nowhere else to go."

Silence settled between them. Not uncomfortable—something closer to understanding. Two people who'd stopped expecting easy answers from each other.

"I don't trust Zaelar," Drusniel said finally. "I don't trust Szoravel. I barely trust myself anymore."

"And me?"

The question hung in the darkness. Drusniel considered it—really considered it, turning it over the way Srietz turned over calculations.

"You came back," he said. "When you didn't have to. When leaving would have been safer."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only one I have." Drusniel let out a breath. "Trust isn't something I'm good at. Never was. Wyrmreach hasn't improved that."

"Then don't trust." Elion's voice was calm. "Just accept that I'm here. That I'm moving in the same direction. Trust can come later. Or not. Direction doesn't require it."

*Direction is just direction.*

Drusniel recognized the philosophy—something born from survival rather than sentiment. He'd been developing his own version of it, these past weeks. Moving forward because stopping wasn't an option. Finding purpose in motion when meaning felt impossible.

"Tomorrow we enter the contested lands," he said.

"Yes."

"The lords will notice us."

"Probably."

"We might not make it to Szoravel."

"That's possible." Elion turned to look at him directly. In the dim glow, his eyes caught light that shouldn't have been there. "But we're going anyway. Because the alternative is staying still. And staying still in Wyrmreach—"

"Gets you killed."

"Gets you killed." Agreement, simple and final. "So we move. We adapt. We survive if we can. And if we can't—" Another shrug. "At least we chose the direction."

Srietz's voice came from nearby, barely above a whisper. "Srietz's turn for watch approaches. But Srietz wishes to note—" A pause. "Srietz finds this conversation unexpectedly reasonable. Srietz may be adjusting calculations regarding group cohesion."

Drusniel almost laughed. Almost.

"Go to sleep, Srietz."

"Srietz will. After watch. And after confirming that Elion has seen nothing dangerous."

"Nothing yet." The shapeshifter rose, stretched muscles that had been still too long. "The night is quiet. The contested lands are ahead. Tomorrow—" He looked east, toward something none of them could see. "Tomorrow we find out what's waiting."

Drusniel closed his eyes. Sleep came eventually—thin, restless, full of dreams he couldn't remember. But it came.

And in the darkness, something like peace settled over their small camp. Not trust. Not safety. Just three people facing the same direction, waiting for dawn.

*Tomorrow, the contested lands. Tonight, something like peace.*
