1. filename: refuge-between-volcanic-needles.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Still as a sentry at the hollow mouth, listening. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Small, methodical motions as he unpacks and counts. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Leaned back against warm stone, eyes fixed east, sleepless tension in his jaw. Wide twilight view of a narrow shelter wedged between towering black volcanic needles; mineral sheen glints on the rock while a tiny defensible camp huddles in the gap and the eastern horizon holds a distant red smear from the contested lands. The red horizon glow bleeds into the grey air, and a hooded lantern inside the hollow leaks a thin warm spill across supplies while the rest sinks into dusk that never becomes fully black. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: srietz-organizes-guard-rotation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Srietz arranged their supplies in neat rows, counting under his breath.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Calm, counting under his breath, placing rations and water in precise lines. [Face_Reference: Elion] At the hollow mouth, a shadow watching shadows, posture controlled. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Sitting back in the dim, eyes irritated from staring too long at the horizon, listening without relaxing. Inside the warm-rock hollow, supplies form neat rows on ash-dusted stone while the three settle into a watch rotation without lighting a fire. Distant red glow from the east paints a faint edge-light on faces; the hooded lantern provides minimal amber fill on hands and food-wrappings, casting long soft shadows across basalt. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drusniel-stares-at-red-horizon.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel leaned against the warm stone and stared at the red glow on the horizon until his eyes burned.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Sleepless focus, eyes watering, jaw locked as his thoughts loop without rest. Close portrait of him leaning against faintly warm volcanic stone, the hollow behind falling away into blur while the eastern red glow pulses like a distant wound beyond the spires. The only light is the far-off volcanic smear and a faint lantern spill that rims his cheek and knuckles, splitting his face into cold red-grey and thin amber. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: trust-is-expensive.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Elion turned then, his profile cutting a sharp line against the volcanic glow.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Controlled expression, profile hard against the horizon, a brief mouth-twitch of dark humor. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Guarded skepticism, eyes narrowed, shoulders tight. Two-shot at the hollow entrance as Elion turns to speak of survival and Drusniel measures him; cramped basalt walls frame them, ash dust drifting in the air. Red horizon glow backlights Elion's profile and cuts a sharp rim along both faces while a hooded lantern inside adds a low warm fill that catches on damp stone and breath fog. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight handheld shake, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: uneasy-rest-before-dawn.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel closed his eyes.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes closed at last, face still tense as if sleep is a negotiation. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Silhouette shifting into the next watch, counting quietly. [Face_Reference: Elion] Still at the hollow mouth, scanning the never-dark. Quiet closing composition: supplies remain in careful rows, the warm stone holds their backs, and the eastern horizon continues to bleed red beyond the spires while they rest without peace. The red glow paints a dull wash across the hollow; the lantern gutter flickers once, throwing a brief amber shimmer over wrapped rations before dimming again. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
