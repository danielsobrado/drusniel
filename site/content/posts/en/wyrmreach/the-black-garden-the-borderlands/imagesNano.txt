1. filename: black-garden-borderlands-overlook.jpg
role: header
prompt:Basalt plateau edge overlooking a vast valley bristling with waist-high faceted black crystal spires arranged in unnervingly precise geometric rows; a ruler-straight corridor of bare earth cuts through the center, three small travelers silhouetted at the rim for scale. Distant volcanic fissure-glow provides low orange underlight that catches as thin specular streaks on glassy facets, while violet luminescence refracts inside the crystal lattice and throws prismatic edge highlights into the chemical haze; steam threads rise from hairline cracks in heat-fractured vesicular basalt and low red flowers cling between shard bases. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: chemical-haze-srietz.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Beside him, Srietz had pulled his scarf over his nose and was breathing in shallow, counted intervals.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Srietz]. Drusniel eyes watering, squinting; Srietz scarf pulled over nose, breathing shallow and counted, gloved finger pointing. They pause beside a black stone territorial marker and a deliberate fence of geometric crystal posts; abstract claw-scored and burned-circle symbols implied but not readable, chemical mist thick at ground level. Orange fissure-light lifts undersides of jaws and knuckles from below as violet glints run along facet edges, scattering through the haze as soft halos; wet basalt pebbles reflect pinpoints of amber like embers and steam threads curl through. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: elion-senses-watchers.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Elion walked point, moving with the fluid economy of someone who'd spent decades navigating danger.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Predatory stillness, head tilted as if listening; weight held off the left leg, fingers raised in a silent halt. He gestures toward a precise arc of taller crystal spires tuned to the corridor; dim heat-veins pulse under black stone and chemical mist clings at shin level. Orange uplight leaks from hairline cracks and violet refraction cuts cool bands through the haze, edging cheekbones and fingertips; shadows pool between spires with violet rims. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, background softened, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: corridor-through-crystals.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The crystals pressed close on either side of the path, their hum deepening as the group passed, and he could swear the formations leaned inward, facets angling to catch their heat, as if each spire were a hand stretching toward something it wanted to touch.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Shoulders tight, gaze fixed forward; one hand forced loose after a single thumb-to-index tap. He advances down a ruler-straight corridor of bare earth between crowded faceted black crystal needles leaning inward, dust motes vibrating and heat shimmer in the air. Internal violet glow refracts into sharp edge highlights skating across facets while orange underglow from subterranean heat-veins lights dust from below so each grain flashes amber; chemical haze blooms the contrast into a soft halo and steam threads cast wavering shadows. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, mild barrel distortion, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: deeper-into-the-garden.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The path led them deeper into the garden.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion, Drusniel, Srietz]. Elion leads without breaking stride, half-glancing to the side; Drusniel refuses to look back, jaw set; Srietz keeps scarf raised, breath controlled in counted intervals. Rear three-quarter wide shot as they walk deeper down the maintained corridor through millions of faceted crystal spires; low red flowers punctuate the black ground and distant taller clusters suggest hidden lookout positions. Violet refraction washes the path edges and pools around boots while a faint orange volcanic underglow backlights drifting steam and dust, glassy facets throwing tiny violet caustics across the bare earth. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight haze bloom, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
