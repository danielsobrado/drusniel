## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The corridor hum deepens under their footsteps. Dust grains lift and tremble in place, vibrating in tight circles. Drusniel’s hand twitches toward his grounding habit, then forces itself still.
[00:03-00:05] Steam threads vent from hairline cracks beside the path and roll across ankles. Violet refractions strobe along the nearest facets as the crystal field “re-tunes” to their heat.
[00:05-00:08] Far ahead, a single spire tilts a few degrees inward. Elion freezes mid-step and raises his fingers — stop. The hum drops half a tone, turning into pressure in the chest.

Slow dolly forward down the corridor, staying just behind Drusniel’s shoulder.
Audio: low subsonic crystal hum, granular gravel crunch, chemical wind hiss, faint steam venting, glassy tick of crystals, a soft inhale held. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
