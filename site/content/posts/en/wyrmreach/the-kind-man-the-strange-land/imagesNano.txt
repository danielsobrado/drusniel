1. filename: first-clear-view-of-wyrmreach.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: stubborn focus, legs shaking as he stands. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: calm guidance, hand steady at Drusniel’s elbow. Outside the tarp shelter on a black-sand coast, Drusniel takes his first unsteady steps into Wyrmreach: black dunes stretch toward crystal-like formations that subtly misalign when not stared at, wrong-colored plants in deep purples and sick greens, and a volcanic glow pulsing on the horizon like a heartbeat. Diffuse red-grey twilight from the sky provides cold fill; the distant volcanic glow adds faint warm-orange rim light, warm pinpoints catching crystal facets and tracing thin highlights along cheek edges while the sand stays matte and deadened. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight motion blur. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: crystals-that-wont-stay-still.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Black sand stretched toward formations that looked like crystal but moved slightly when he wasn't looking directly at them.")
prompt:Photorealistic close-up of jagged crystal formations rising from black sand, faceted like mineral deposits but subtly misaligned as if they shift between glances; wrong-colored plants cling at the base in deep purples and sick greens. Red-grey twilight sky provides cold diffuse fill; faint volcanic glow on the horizon catches edges in warm pinpoints, thin highlights skating across individual facets while the sand absorbs light into near-black. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: merrik-points-east.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Merrik pointed.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: quiet authority, arm extended pointing east. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: sharp tired stare, posture rigid to hide weakness. Merrik points toward the pulsing volcanic glow and the contested lands beyond, unclaimed coast stretching behind them with shifting crystals and bruised plants like a warning. Twilight sky gives flat red-grey fill; the horizon glow adds a warm rim along the pointing hand and a thin orange line on Drusniel’s cheek edge, reflections catching on crystal seams while the rest stays matte. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: valuable-survivors-warning.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel filed the information away.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: calm warning, eyes calculating. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: hardening at the word valuable, threat-assessment sharpening. Close two-shot on the black-sand coast as Merrik speaks of hunters who pay for survivors; shifting crystals and wrong plants stretch behind them, turning the warning into landscape. Warm shelter firelight from off-frame adds low amber side light that catches pores and knuckle ridges; red-grey twilight fills shadows cold and flat, keeping the horizon ominously alive. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: he-counts-the-delays.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel counted.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: contained impatience, eyes sharp; fingers counting deliberately over an untouched bowl. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: practiced calm, moving in the background. Back under the tarp shelter, wind tugs and snaps the canvas while the small fire keeps a thin thread of warmth alive; Drusniel counts questions and delays as if turning patience into strategy. Firelight from low center frame throws warm orange across hands and bowl rim, reflections sliding over the glaze; tarp shadow drops the background into near-black with faint red-grey ambient outlining the shelter edge. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
