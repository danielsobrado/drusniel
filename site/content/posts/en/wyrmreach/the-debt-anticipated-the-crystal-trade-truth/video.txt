## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Srietz holds the black crystal up, turning it slowly. The crystal drinks light — violet luminescence pulses faintly within the lattice structure, shifting with the rotation. His ears press forward with urgency.
[00:03-00:05] Drusniel leans closer, eyes narrowing on the crystal. The violet glow catches his face from below. Behind them, the black crystal formations jut from the ground like broken teeth, their own faint luminescence echoing the handheld specimen.
[00:05-00:08] Srietz's grip tightens. He pulls the crystal back to his chest protectively. His expression shifts from urgency to something colder — the look of someone who's counted the cost and doesn't like the number.

Slow dolly-in from waist to the crystal in his hand.
Audio: low crystalline hum, faint crackling from the crystal lattice, wind through the volcanic pass. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
