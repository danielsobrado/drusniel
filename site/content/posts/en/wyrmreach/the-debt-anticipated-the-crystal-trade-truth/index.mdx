## Chapter 23 | Part 4

--- 

Srietz waited until the fourth day to talk.

The goblin had been assembling information the way he assembled alchemical compounds: one ingredient at a time, measured, tested for purity, set aside until the full recipe was ready. Drusniel had watched him over the last three days doing quiet things. Scraping crystal residue from rock faces when Talryn's back was turned. Sniffing the air near the black crystal deposits that jutted from the ground like broken teeth. Running his thumb across the small sample pouch he carried, the one with the crystals Nyxara had provided as part of the travel terms.

Now, on the last morning before the border, Srietz had his recipe.

Talryn was ahead, scouting the route through a narrow pass between two ridges. She'd gone around a bend in the stone. For the first time in four days, she was out of sight.

Srietz spoke fast and low, the way he spoke when pricing urgent goods.

"The black crystals. Srietz knows what they are for." He pulled one from the pouch and held it up. In the dim light, the crystal's surface seemed to drink rather than reflect. "Not tools. Not fuel. Not the simple medicinal agents Nyxara implied."

Drusniel stopped walking. Elion closed the gap behind them.

"The crystalline structure is a delivery system," Srietz continued, turning the sample between his clawed fingers. "Srietz has seen this architecture before. In Duskfall Reach. In the compliance markets below the third shelf. The molecular lattice is designed to bind with neural tissue. When consumed, dissolved, or even held against skin for extended periods, the crystal releases compounds that alter decision-making thresholds."

"Meaning what?" Elion said.

"Meaning they make you agree." Srietz's ears were flat against his skull. "Not puppetry. Not control in the crude sense. The compounds lower resistance to suggestion. They make commands feel reasonable. They make obedience feel like choice. A soldier given crystal-laced water for a week will follow orders he'd have questioned before, and he'll believe he's following them freely."

The pass was quiet around them. Somewhere ahead, Talryn's footsteps moved across stone, regular and measured.

"Nyxara's real trade is not flowers," Srietz said. "The flowers are raw material. Beautiful, profitable raw material, yes, but the end product is the crystals. She refines, processes, and distributes compliance agents to every faction in Wyrmreach that wants loyalty without earning it. Warlords. Settlement leaders. Anyone with power and a population that asks too many questions."

Drusniel looked at the crystal in Srietz's hand. He'd held those crystals. Carried them in his pack. The ones Nyxara gave them for the journey, the ones described as stabilizers, as aids against the environmental effects of deep Wyrmreach travel.

"The ones she gave us," he said.

"Are safe. Srietz checked. Low concentration, genuine stabilizing properties, no neural binding agents." The goblin tucked the sample away. "Nyxara is not poisoning her guests. She is far too smart for that. But the crystals she trades? The ones that flow out of her territory in sealed containers? Those are weapons. Quiet, invisible, deniable weapons that turn populations into willing servants."

"She controls Wyrmreach's obedience supply," Drusniel said.

"Srietz would say she controls the market for voluntary compliance. The distinction matters to alchemists, if not to the victims." The goblin's voice held a bitterness Drusniel had rarely heard from him. Srietz calculated costs. He priced everything. But some prices, it seemed, still bothered him. "The flowers are the source. The crystals are the product. The guide, the safe passage, the generous terms? All of it is packaging. We are being escorted through the largest mind-control operation in Wyrmreach, and we accepted the hospitality without understanding the merchandise."

Behind them, a boot scraped stone.

Talryn stood at the bend in the pass, eight feet away. She had returned without sound, and the scrape had been deliberate. A choice to announce herself rather than continue listening unseen. Her face held an expression Drusniel had never seen on it before.

Anger. Controlled, channeled through years of discipline, but present. A tightness around her eyes and mouth that broke the mask of professional neutrality she'd worn for four days. The expression lasted two seconds, maybe three, before the mask rebuilt itself from the jaw up. But they'd all seen it.

Srietz's ears went rigid. Elion shifted his weight onto his back foot.

Talryn looked at each of them in turn. Then she shouldered her pack and walked past without a word.

The silence that followed was different from any silence they'd shared with the guide. The previous silences had been professional. This one had edges.

They walked for an hour without speaking. Talryn's pace increased. Not dramatically, not punitively, but enough that Srietz had to lengthen his stride and Drusniel caught himself breathing harder than the terrain warranted. The guide's efficiency had sharpened into something colder, her route choices less accommodating, her pause-points shorter.

Drusniel tried something.

He stopped counting. Stopped tracing cracks, stopped cataloging the guide's behavioral shifts, stopped analyzing the terrain for patterns and the group dynamic for data points. He'd been running those processes since they left Nyxara's territory, constant background calculations that ate attention but provided structure. Now he shut them down. Deliberately. Completely.

He tried to just walk. To be present in his body, in the landscape, in the moment. No analysis. No measurement. No pattern recognition.

The world went blurry at the edges. Not literally, but perceptually. Without the frameworks he usually imposed, the volcanic terrain became a mass of undifferentiated detail, stone and shadow and heat all bleeding together. He felt off-balance despite flat ground, as if the mental scaffolding he'd dismantled had been load-bearing after all.

Talryn signaled a direction change. A subtle gesture, two fingers pointing left. Drusniel missed it. He was looking at the sky, trying to experience it rather than measure it, and by the time he registered that the group had turned, Elion had already stepped in front of him and corrected his path with a hand on his shoulder.

"Left," Elion said.

Drusniel nodded and fell back into line, feeling stupid in a way that had nothing to do with intelligence. He'd tried to abandon his wiring and nearly walked off the approved route on a day when walking off the approved route could mean anything from territorial trespass to death.

The counting started again within minutes. The crack-tracing resumed by the next rest stop. Not because he chose to restart them, but because his mind simply did what it did, the way lungs breathe and hearts beat. Those processes weren't habits. They were him.

At the day's final halt, Talryn built the fire with precise, mechanical movements that carried none of the casual competence of previous nights. She set the perimeter. Distributed rations. Took her position on the high ground.

Then she spoke.

"Lady Nyxara knew the goblin would talk." Her voice carried the distance between them, cold and clear. "She estimated the third day. The goblin lasted until the fourth." A pause that lasted exactly long enough to be uncomfortable. "Lady Nyxara does not enjoy losing bets."

Srietz went very still.

"She bet on when Srietz would talk?" The goblin's voice was carefully controlled.

"She bet on when. Not whether." Talryn's eyes were fixed on the darkening horizon. "The whether was never in question."
