1. filename: boat-waiting-in-tooth-rock-cove.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Tense, scanning the water, artifact glow under his tunic. Drusniel stands at the mouth of a cove framed by jagged black rocks shaped like broken teeth, a small reinforced boat on wooden rollers behind him, flat black water stretching into featureless grey beyond. Pale sourceless grey light illuminating everything without shadows, faint cold sheen on the rock surfaces. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: reinforced-hull-and-supplies.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Oars lay secured inside, and there was a coil of rope, a waterskin, and nothing else.")
prompt: Close-up of the small boat resting on wooden rollers in the cove. Dark treated wood banded with cold metal strips, slick with a sheen that is not quite moisture. Oars lashed inside beside a coil of rope and a single waterskin. Pale grey ambient light reflecting off the metal bands and wet-looking wood grain. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shore-disappears-behind.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The shore behind him had vanished.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Stunned calculating stare, looking back over his shoulder. Drusniel rows a small boat on flat black water that extends in every direction with no shore visible, no horizon, no reference point. Flat grey sourceless light illuminating his face evenly without casting shadows, faint reflection on the water surface. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: wave-with-wrong-angle.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A wave rose ahead of him.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Gripping the gunwales, jaw clenched, fighting for balance. An unnatural wave rises from the flat black surface at a wrong angle, tilting the boat violently. Heavy black liquid sloshes over the gunwales into the hull around his boots. Grey sourceless light catching the crest of the wave, dark water surface absorbing all reflection below. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: something-circles-below.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "And below him, in the darkness beneath the hull, something stirred.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Leaning over the side, face tight with dread, eyes locked on the water. A vast indistinct shadow shifts beneath the hull of the rocking boat, not attacking, only circling. Black water surface too calm between wrong swells, the shadow darker than the surrounding depths. Pale grey ambient light from above, faint reflection on the water surface near the hull. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
