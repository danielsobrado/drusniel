## Chapter 9 | Part 1

---

The water was wrong before he touched it.

Drusniel stood at the edge where stone met liquid, the artifact cold against his chest. He had expected darkness. He had expected cold. What he had not expected was the weight of the air itself pressing against his lungs, as if the sea resented his presence before he'd taken a single step.

He counted the distance to the far shore. One, two, three, the numbers scattered. He tried again. The horizon refused to hold still, stretching and contracting like something breathing. He had measured distances his entire life. This one would not be measured.

*Three hundred paces north*, Zaelar had said. *Black rocks shaped like broken teeth.*

He found the cove exactly where it should have been. The rocks jutted from the shore like the jaw of some ancient beast, and behind them, the cave entrance was barely visible, a shadow darker than the surrounding stone. Drusniel descended carefully, counting his steps on loose gravel that shouldn't exist this close to water.

The boat sat exactly where Zaelar had promised.

Small. Reinforced hull, metal bands wrapped around dark wood that looked like it had been treated with something to resist rot. The craft rested on wooden rollers, ready to be pushed into the water. Oars lay secured inside, and there was a coil of rope, a waterskin, and nothing else. No comfort. Just function.

He ran his hand along the gunwale. The wood was cold, slick with something that wasn't quite moisture. The boat had been waiting here, maintained but unused, holding vigil over a crossing that might never happen.

*The boat gives you options*, Zaelar had said. *A platform to work from.*

Drusniel pushed it down to the water's edge. The rollers made it easier than it should have been, and when the hull touched the nightmare sea, the water responded, pulling, testing, as if deciding whether to accept the intrusion or reject it.

He climbed in before he could reconsider.

The boat rocked as his weight settled. Wrong movement, too slow, then too fast, as if the water beneath couldn't decide on density. He gripped the sides, testing his balance, and the artifact pulsed against his sternum. With each pulse came that sensation, magical suffocation. His connection to the air around him, always present since childhood, felt muted. Strangled.

*Zaelar's instructions had been precise. Cross the nightmare sea. Find Szoravel. Use the boat to pace yourself. Simple words for an impossible task.*

He pushed off from the shore with one oar.

The boat glided forward, except it didn't quite glide. The motion was stuttered, jerking, as if moving through liquid that kept changing its mind about what liquid should behave like. Drusniel gripped both oars and began to row.

The cold was not cold. That was the first wrongness. Temperature existed here only as memory, as suggestion. The water resisted his oars without wetness, pressed against the hull without proper physics. His body insisted the boat was floating. The water insisted nothing made sense.

Three strokes. Four. The shore behind him had vanished. Not faded into distance, simply stopped existing. He turned his head and saw only the flat, black surface stretching in every direction, broken by nothing, reflecting nothing.

Light didn't work here. Not properly. There was illumination, enough to see his own hands, enough to watch the water swallow the oar blades, but the light had no source. It simply *was*, pale and grey and wrong, coming from everywhere and nowhere, casting no shadows.

Drusniel tried to count the strokes he would need. His mind ran the calculation automatically: distance divided by stroke length, adjusted for current, adjusted for fatigue. But the distance kept changing. The numbers refused to stay fixed. Three became seven became three again, and none of them meant anything.

He forced himself to breathe. The air tasted like copper, like blood, like something that had never been meant for lungs. Each breath felt borrowed, temporary, as if the atmosphere itself was rationing what it would give him.

The artifact continued its muted pulse against his chest. With each beat, his magic felt more distant. The air around him, once an extension of himself, now felt like a stranger he vaguely recognized. He could still sense it, barely, but reaching for it required effort that should have been instinct.

*This is what the artifact does*, he realized. *It doesn't block magic. It makes magic forget you exist.*

The thought should have frightened him more than it did. Perhaps fear required energy he no longer had.

He rowed. Ten strokes. Twenty. The boat cut through water that refused to behave, thick as honey, thin as air, sometimes both at once. The oars caught resistance that came and went without pattern. His arms burned with effort that accomplished distances he couldn't measure.

*Keep moving. Don't think. Just move.*

A wave rose ahead of him.

Not a normal wave. The nightmare sea had been flat, utterly still, and now something was pushing up from below, a swell that grew without wind, without reason. Drusniel reached for his water affinity instinctively, trying to sense the current, to understand what was happening.

The water *noticed*.

He felt it immediately, that sudden, absolute attention. Not from the wave. From something beneath it. Something vast and patient that had been waiting in the depths, and his magic had just lit a torch in the darkness.

The wave crested, wrong-angled, approaching from a direction that shouldn't exist.

Drusniel grabbed the oars and pulled hard, trying to angle the bow into it. The boat responded sluggishly, fighting the water's density. The wave hit sideways, lifting the hull, tilting it at an angle that defied physics.

He didn't capsize. The boat righted itself, or the wave decided to let it, and crashed down hard enough that his teeth clacked together. Water sloshed over the gunwales, not much, but the liquid that spilled into the boat was wrong. Heavier than water. Colder than cold. It pooled at his feet like something thinking about whether to stay.

*The boat doesn't eliminate the danger*, Zaelar had said. *It gives you a chance to control it.*

Control. Right.

Drusniel reached for his air magic. Not to breathe, not yet. To push. He needed wind, needed thrust, needed something to move him forward faster than rowing could accomplish. The artifact pulsed against his chest, fighting him, but desperation was fuel.

Air formed around the boat, barely. A current that didn't belong here, forced into existence by will alone. It caught the stern and pushed, and the boat lurched forward with sudden speed that felt like falling.

The water responded immediately.

Waves rose from every direction at once. Not natural swells but movements with purpose, with intelligence. The sea had noticed his magic, had noticed him pushing against it, and it was pushing back.

The boat pitched violently. Drusniel grabbed the sides, his air working dissolving as his concentration shattered. Water crashed over the bow, heavy and wrong, filling the hull faster than physics should allow.

He bailed with his hands, pointless, desperate, and the boat tilted again, lifted by a wave that came from below, from angles that made no sense.

And below him, in the darkness beneath the hull, something stirred.

Not moving toward him. Not yet. Just... noticing.

Something vast and patient, something that had been waiting in the deep.

His magic had announced him. Like lighting a torch in a dark room where predators hunted by sight.

The attention pressed against his consciousness, heavy and absolute. Whatever was down there, it knew exactly where he was now.

Drusniel's mind, trained to calculate, to analyze, to find solutions in numbers, ran the arithmetic without permission. Current rate of water intake: unsustainable. Distance to shore: unknown. Remaining magical reserves: perhaps three more workings before complete exhaustion. Each working bought him forward motion but drew more attention from below.

The math didn't work. The math couldn't work.

He was going to die doing arithmetic in a boat that shouldn't float.

Something moved beneath the hull. Not swimming. Circling. Waiting for him to weaken.
