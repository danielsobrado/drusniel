# Chapter 9.1 | The Black Water

The water was wrong before he touched it.

Drusniel stood at the edge where stone met liquid, the artifact cold against his chest. He had expected darkness. He had expected cold. What he had not expected was the weight of the air itself pressing against his lungs, as if the sea resented his presence before he'd taken a single step.

He counted the distance to the far shore. One, two, three—the numbers scattered. He tried again. The horizon refused to hold still, stretching and contracting like something breathing. He had measured distances his entire life. This one would not be measured.

*Zaelar's instructions had been precise. Cross the nightmare sea. Find Szoravel. Simple words for an impossible task.*

The artifact pulsed against his sternum, and with each pulse came that sensation—magical suffocation. His connection to the air around him, always present since childhood, felt muted. Strangled. As if someone had wrapped wet cloth around his lungs and squeezed. He reached for the familiar threads of his air affinity and found them distant, thin, barely there.

He stepped into the water.

The cold was not cold. That was the first wrongness. Temperature existed here only as memory, as suggestion. What hit his ankles was pressure without sensation, weight without wetness. His body insisted he was submerged. His skin insisted nothing was there.

Two steps. Three. The water reached his knees, and the density shifted. Thicker now, resisting each movement like pushing through cooling wax. He counted his heartbeats—one, two, three, four—and four happened twice. He stopped counting.

The training Zaelar had given him felt like holding a candle against a storm. Breathe. Focus. Control. The words meant nothing here. Control required understanding, and he understood nothing about this place. The water pressed against him from angles that shouldn't exist. Above. Below. From directions his body couldn't name.

He was waist-deep now. The shore behind him had vanished. Not faded into distance—simply stopped existing. He turned his head and saw only the flat, black surface stretching in every direction, broken by nothing, reflecting nothing.

Light didn't work here. Not properly. There was illumination—enough to see his own hands, enough to watch the water swallow his torso—but the light had no source. It simply *was*, pale and grey and wrong, coming from everywhere and nowhere, casting no shadows.

Drusniel tried to count the strokes he would need. His mind ran the calculation automatically: distance divided by stroke length, adjusted for current, adjusted for fatigue. But the distance kept changing. The numbers refused to stay fixed. Three became seven became three again, and none of them meant anything.

The water reached his chest.

He forced himself to breathe. The air tasted like copper, like blood, like something that had never been meant for lungs. Each breath felt borrowed, temporary, as if the atmosphere itself was rationing what it would give him.

His feet found purchase on something below—not rock, not sand, something that yielded slightly under his weight and then pushed back. He didn't want to know what it was. He kept moving.

The artifact continued its muted pulse against his chest. With each beat, his magic felt more distant. The air around him, once an extension of himself, now felt like a stranger he vaguely recognized. He could still sense it—barely—but reaching for it required effort that should have been instinct.

*This is what the artifact does*, he realized. *It doesn't block magic. It makes magic forget you exist.*

The thought should have frightened him more than it did. Perhaps fear required energy he no longer had.

He was shoulder-deep now. The water pressed against his throat, and the pressure was wrong—stronger from above than below, as if something was pushing down on the surface. He tilted his head back, gasping at the metallic air, and saw nothing above him. No sky. No ceiling. Just grey emptiness that went on forever.

*Keep moving. Don't think. Just move.*

He pushed forward, and the bottom disappeared.

One moment his feet were touching something solid. The next, there was nothing. The water didn't behave like water should—it didn't support him, didn't let him float. Instead, it pulled him in directions that made no sense. Sideways. Diagonally. In orientations his body couldn't process.

Drusniel's arms moved automatically, seeking purchase in liquid that refused to behave. He kicked, and his legs moved through the water without resistance. Then the water closed around them like a fist.

He tried to count. One stroke, two strokes—

Three happened, and then three happened again.

Time was broken here. Not slowed, not stopped. *Broken*. Seconds repeated themselves. Moments folded back on their own beginnings. He couldn't trust his count. He couldn't trust anything.

The water filled his ears, and sound became meaningless. His own heartbeat echoed from somewhere below him, as if his heart had fallen out and was pounding in the depths, calling something to attention.

He needed air.

His lungs burned with the need for it, but the surface—if there still was a surface—was somewhere he couldn't find. Up and down had divorced each other. Every direction felt equally wrong.

Drusniel reached for his magic. Just a small working. Just enough air to buy himself seconds to think.

The artifact pulsed, and the magic came—thin, reluctant, barely a whisper of what it should have been. A bubble of air formed around his mouth, small and pathetic, tasting of copper and desperation.

He breathed it in. One breath. Maybe two. Then it was gone.

And below him, in the darkness where his heartbeat echoed, something stirred.

Not moving toward him. Not yet. Just... noticing.

Something vast. Something patient. Something that had been waiting.

His magic had announced him. Like lighting a torch in a dark room where predators hunted by sight.

The attention pressed against his consciousness, heavy and absolute. Whatever was down there, it knew exactly where he was now.

Drusniel's mind, trained to calculate, to analyze, to find solutions in numbers, ran the arithmetic without permission. Two air workings remaining, maybe three if he pushed himself to breaking. Each working bought thirty seconds. Ninety seconds total. Maybe one hundred twenty if he didn't panic.

The shore was nowhere.

The math didn't work. The math couldn't work.

He was going to die doing arithmetic.

Something moved beneath him. Not swimming. Waiting.
