1. filename: running-through-the-twisted-forest.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Full sprint panic; Srietz cutting decisive angles, Drusniel running with jaw tight, Elion matching pace with controlled unnatural smoothness. They tear through twisted forest where black crystal formations jut from the ground and a nearby boulder seems to hum with unpleasant energy; a slope appears only when approached from the right angle, forcing them into a specific line. Dim overcast daylight filtered through canopy and haze flattens the world into cold greys; crystal facets show internal refraction and throw brief sharp glints onto damp moss, wet bark flashes with quick specular highlights, and grit sprays up catching tiny points of light as the shrieks behind them vibrate the undergrowth. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: coatly-in-the-trees.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel looked back anyway.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Reckless glance back; eyes widening as he breaks Srietz's warning. Coatly sweep between the trees: slick leathery wing membranes with too many joints, creasing at impossible angles; one dives straight toward him mid-shriek, close enough that the air seems disturbed. Cold overcast daylight filtered through branches catches as hard specular streaks on wet wing membrane and highlights on joint ridges; the forest behind collapses into dark vertical streaks and shadow pockets that hide the rest of the swarm, with motion blur smearing trunks into bars. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight barrel distortion, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: no-magic-it-hears-you.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel's magic surged without thought.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel]. Instinct and immediate regret; Drusniel casting without thinking, Srietz whipping around in panic and fury. A compressed burst of air slams a diving Coatly sideways, throwing leaves and black volcanic grit into the air; thin branches bend flat, the creature tumbles through frame as more shrieks answer from all directions. Dim overcast daylight gives cold fill; debris catches brief glittering highlights, grit grains sparkle as tiny points, and wing-beats passing overhead deepen shadow bands between trunks like moving stripes across faces and stone. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in debris. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: crack-too-tight-to-fly.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "They don't like enclosed spaces.")
prompt:Claustrophobic squeeze through a narrow rock crack where wings cannot fit: Srietz slips through first, Drusniel scrapes shoulders and pack on jagged stone, and Elion contorts to pass in a way that looks wrong but controlled. Outside the slit, Coatly screams stack and echo while fast shadows flicker across the rock as they wheel overhead. A thin strip of overcast daylight spills through the crack from behind, raking cold light across quartz grit and rough rock grain; dust hangs as a pale volume and the bright slit blooms into halation while the space ahead falls into near-black. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: vextrath-hunts-his-property.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Vexrath does not like it when property leaves.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel]. Breathless dread; Drusniel forcing the urge to cast down, jaw clenched; Srietz speaking flatly with fear held tight under the words. Inside a dark cave beyond the crack, vesicular volcanic stone walls sweat with damp, grit clings to boots, and the outside shrieks are muffled but present. Faint violet mineral luminescence from deeper seams provides cold low fill with soft halation, catching wet stone texture and painting thin highlights on faces; the last trace of grey daylight from the crack behind gives weak back rim and turns drifting dust into a dim halo. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
