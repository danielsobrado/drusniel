1. filename: running-through-the-twisted-forest.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, full sprint panic; Srietz cuts decisive angles without hesitation, Drusniel runs with jaw tight and eyes flicking to the treeline, and Elion matches pace with controlled, unnatural smoothness. They tear through a twisted stretch of forest where black crystal formations jut from the ground and a boulder near the path seems to hum with unpleasant energy; the terrain breaks into a slope that only makes sense when approached from the right angle, forcing them into a specific line. Dim overcast daylight filtered through canopy and haze flattens the world into cold greys, while crystal facets catch brief sharp glints and wet bark flashes as they pass; the shrieks behind them feel close enough to vibrate the undergrowth. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: coatly-in-the-trees.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel looked back anyway.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Photorealistic, reckless glance back; eyes widening as he breaks Srietz's warning. Coatly sweep between the trees like bat-things gone wrong: wings with too many joints, slick leathery membranes that crease at impossible angles, and bodies that bend in ways flesh should not; one dives straight toward him mid-shriek, close enough that the air looks disturbed around it. Cold overcast daylight filters through branches and catches on wet wing membranes in brief hard highlights, while the forest behind collapses into dark vertical streaks and shadow pockets that hide the rest of the swarm. Sony A7R IV 16mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight barrel distortion, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: no-magic-it-hears-you.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel's magic surged without thought.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel] Photorealistic, instinct and immediate regret; Drusniel's focus snaps hard as he casts without thinking, while Srietz's face twists into panic and fury mid-run as he realizes what that means. A compressed burst of air slams a diving Coatly sideways, making leaves and black grit explode outward and bending thin branches flat; the creature's body tumbles through the frame as more shrieks answer from all directions. Dim overcast daylight gives cold fill, but the burst throws debris into a brief glittering spray of highlights; shadow pockets between trunks deepen as wing-beats pass overhead, turning the forest into moving stripes. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in debris. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: crack-too-tight-to-fly.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "They don't like enclosed spaces.")
prompt:Photorealistic, claustrophobic squeeze through a narrow rock crack where wings cannot fit: Srietz slips through first, Drusniel scrapes his shoulders and pack against jagged stone, and Elion contorts to pass in a way that looks wrong but controlled. Outside the slit, Coatly screams stack and echo in frustrated circles, and fast-moving shadows flicker across the stone as they wheel overhead. A thin strip of overcast daylight spills through the crack from behind them, raking cold light across rough rock texture and turning dust into a pale haze, while the space ahead falls into near-black where the crack widens. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation at the bright slit, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: vextrath-hunts-his-property.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Vexrath does not like it when property leaves.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel] Photorealistic, breathless dread; Drusniel's jaw clenched as he listens, forcing the urge to cast down, while Srietz speaks flatly with fear held tight under his words. Inside a dark cave beyond the crack, volcanic stone walls sweat with damp and grit clings to boots; the shrieks outside are muffled by rock but still present, patient. Faint violet mineral luminescence from deeper seams gives a cold low fill that catches wet stone texture and paints thin highlights on faces, while the last trace of grey daylight from the crack behind them provides a weak back rim and turns drifting dust into a dim halo. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation in the violet glow, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
