# Chapter 9.4 | The Depths

Light appeared ahead.

Not the pale, sourceless illumination of the nightmare sea. Real light. Reddish. Volcanic. The color of fire seen through smoke, distant but getting closer with each desperate stroke of the oars.

Drusniel didn't trust it. He'd learned not to trust anything in this place. But whether it was real or another hallucination, it gave him something to aim for. Direction. Purpose. The illusion of progress.

His arms moved automatically now. Pull. Release. Pull. Release. He'd lost feeling in them hours ago—or minutes ago, time still didn't work properly—but they continued functioning through pure mechanical habit. His body had become a machine whose only purpose was rowing.

The water around the boat began to change.

Still wrong. Still impossible. But *less* wrong. The density stabilized. The pressure began to make sense. Direction reasserted itself—up was up, down was down, and ahead was ahead instead of some angle that hurt to conceptualize.

The debt in his chest pulsed with each heartbeat. A constant reminder of what he'd accepted, what he now owed. The bargain he'd made in desperation—real or hallucinated—had left its mark. He could feel the hook, the thread connecting him to something vast and patient.

*Later*, he told himself. *Worry about that later. Right now, just survive.*

The volcanic light grew brighter. Drusniel could make out shapes now—a horizon that stayed fixed instead of breathing, a shoreline that wasn't shifting position. The nightmare sea was ending. The crossing was almost complete.

Almost.

The boat shuddered.

The boat shuddered.

Not from waves. From something beneath—a current that hadn't existed moments before, pulling the hull forward with force that had nothing to do with his rowing. The nightmare sea was pushing him now. Hurrying him along. As if it had decided he'd suffered enough, or as if something about the bargain he'd struck required his survival.

Drusniel didn't question it. He angled the bow toward the volcanic light and let the current take him.

The water's wrongness faded with each passing moment. Temperature returned—cold, properly cold, no longer the suggestion of temperature but actual sensation. The liquid flowing past the hull began to behave like water should, with physics that made sense, with resistance that could be calculated.

Time stabilized. One second followed another in predictable sequence. Drusniel counted his heartbeats—one, two, three, four—and four only happened once.

Shore materialized ahead.

Black sand beneath a sky that was entirely wrong—red-tinged, perpetual twilight, volcanic glow on the horizon pulsing like a heartbeat. This was not Astalor. This was not anywhere he had ever been.

This was Wyrmreach.

The current carried the boat into shallows, and the hull scraped against sand with a sound that was almost normal. Almost comforting. Drusniel tried to stand, but his legs refused. His arms barely responded to commands. His magic was empty—genuinely depleted, scraped out like the inside of a jar.

He climbed out of the boat. More like fell out, really. His legs buckled when they hit solid ground, and he collapsed onto black sand that was warm, almost hot—volcanic origin.

*I made it.*

The thought should have brought relief. Instead, it brought only exhaustion and confusion. He was alive. He was on Wyrmreach's shore. He had crossed the nightmare sea using Zaelar's boat and his own magic and pure stubborn refusal to die.

And he had made a bargain with something that hadn't bothered to explain what it wanted in return.

The debt pulsed in his chest. Real. Undeniable. A hook anchored beside his heart, connected to something vast and patient by a thread he couldn't see or touch but absolutely knew was there.

His hands sank into the black sand. The air tasted of sulfur and metal. Everything was wrong—the colors, the temperature, the way the light fell without casting proper shadows. This place operated by different rules than anywhere he'd been before.

*Find Szoravel*, Zaelar had said. *Simple words for an impossible task.*

Drusniel tried to count his heartbeats. One, two, three—the numbers held. Time worked here. That was something.

He tried to stand again. Failed again. His body had nothing left. The crossing had taken everything from him, and whatever bargain he'd struck hadn't included recovery. It had included survival. Nothing more.

Behind him, the boat rested half in the water, half on the sand. Battered but intact. It had done its job—given him a platform to work from, a way to control the crossing instead of being controlled by it. Zaelar had been right about that much, at least.

Somewhere behind him, the nightmare sea stretched toward a horizon that barely existed. Somewhere ahead of him, Wyrmreach waited with dangers he couldn't imagine. And somewhere in between, something approached on the sand.

Footsteps. Getting closer.

He couldn't move. Couldn't turn his head. Could only wait, face-down in warm black sand, to learn whether he had survived the sea only to die on the shore.

The footsteps stopped. A shadow fell across him, blocking the red-tinged light.

Someone was standing there. Watching. Deciding.

Drusniel's consciousness flickered, exhaustion dragging him toward darkness that had nothing to do with the nightmare sea. His last thought before the world faded was a number: one.

One debt owed. One unknown favor promised. One chance spent.

He had a feeling it wouldn't be the last.
