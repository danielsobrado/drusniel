# Chapter 9.4 | The Depths

Power flooded through him.

Not his power. Something else. Something that fit him like a glove fits a hand it was made to wear—perfectly, inevitably, *wrongly*. The magic rushed through channels that had always existed but had never been used, filling spaces he hadn't known were empty.

The darkness in his lungs *burned*.

Drusniel's body convulsed, but this time with purpose. The nothing-water that had filled him erupted outward, expelled by force that wasn't his own, replaced by air that tasted like lightning and old stone and something he couldn't name. He gasped, and the gasp was huge, desperate, *alive*.

The thing below retreated.

Not slowly. Not cautiously. It *fled*, diving deeper into the nightmare sea with something that felt almost like fear. Whatever power was moving through Drusniel, the vast presence recognized it. Respected it. Perhaps feared it.

He was moving now. Not swimming—he had no control over this, no say in direction or speed. The power simply *took* him, carrying him through the broken water like a current that answered to older laws than physics. The density shifts that had fought him before parted like curtains. The time distortions that had broken his counting smoothed into something almost linear.

*What is this?* his mind demanded. *What did I agree to?*

No answer came. The power didn't explain itself. It simply worked, vast and ancient and utterly indifferent to his questions. He was a vessel now, being moved by something that had existed long before he was born and would exist long after he was forgotten.

The artifact against his chest had gone silent. Not suppressing anymore—*quiet*, as if it recognized a greater authority and had stepped aside. That terrified him more than anything else. The artifact had fought his magic with something like hatred. It acknowledged *this* power without resistance.

Light appeared ahead.

Not the pale, sourceless illumination of the nightmare sea. Real light. Reddish. Volcanic. The color of fire seen through smoke, distant but growing closer with impossible speed.

Drusniel's body moved without his input, arms and legs functioning in perfect coordination, carrying him toward that light with mechanical precision. He couldn't have stopped if he'd wanted to. He wasn't sure he wanted to. Dying had been certain. This was unknown.

Unknown was better than certain death. Probably.

The water changed around him. Still wrong, still impossible, but *less* wrong. The density stabilized. The pressure began to make sense. Direction reasserted itself—up was up, down was down, and the surface was somewhere above.

His head broke through.

Air hit his face—real air, thick with sulfur and ash but *real*, filling lungs that still ached from being invaded. Drusniel gasped, choked, coughed up liquid that looked like water but tasted like nothing. The power continued to move him, carrying him forward with strokes he wasn't choosing to make.

Shore appeared in the distance. Black sand beneath a sky that was entirely wrong—red-tinged, perpetual twilight, volcanic glow on the horizon pulsing like a heartbeat. This was not Astalor. This was not anywhere he had ever been.

This was Wyrmreach.

The power deposited him in the shallows and then simply... stopped. One moment it was there, vast and undeniable, moving through him like he was nothing more than a conduit. The next moment it was gone, withdrawn so completely that he couldn't even remember exactly what it had felt like.

What remained was the debt.

He could feel it. Not in his mind—deeper than that. A hook in his chest, anchored to something fundamental, connected to whatever had saved him by a thread he couldn't see or touch but absolutely knew was there. A favor owed. Unspecified. Undefined. But *real*, as real as the sand under his hands and the wrong sky above his head.

Drusniel tried to stand. His legs refused. His arms barely held him upright, shaking with exhaustion that went beyond physical. His magic was empty, not suppressed anymore but genuinely depleted, scraped out like the inside of a jar. The artifact had gone silent and cold against his chest.

*I made it.*

The thought should have brought relief. Instead, it brought only confusion. He was alive. He was on Wyrmreach's shore. He had crossed the nightmare sea, something Zaelar had implied was barely possible for someone with his abilities.

And he had done it by accepting help from something that hadn't bothered to explain what it wanted in return.

His hands sank into the black sand. Warm, almost hot—volcanic origin, he realized distantly. The air tasted of sulfur and metal and things he couldn't identify. Everything was wrong. The colors, the temperature, the way the light fell without casting proper shadows. This place operated by different rules than anywhere he'd been before.

*Find Szoravel*, Zaelar had said. *Simple words for an impossible task.*

Drusniel tried to count his heartbeats. One, two, three—the numbers held. Time worked here. That was something.

He tried to stand again. Failed again. His body had nothing left. The crossing had taken everything from him, and whatever had saved him hadn't bothered to restore what it had used.

*The debt doesn't include recovery*, he realized. *It includes survival. Nothing more.*

Somewhere behind him, the nightmare sea stretched toward a horizon that didn't exist. Somewhere ahead of him, Wyrmreach waited with dangers he couldn't imagine. And somewhere in between, something approached on the sand.

Footsteps. Getting closer.

He couldn't move. Couldn't turn his head. Could only wait, face-down in warm black sand, to learn whether he had survived the sea only to die on the shore.

The footsteps stopped. A shadow fell across him, blocking the red-tinged light.

Someone was standing there. Watching. Deciding.

Drusniel's consciousness flickered, exhaustion dragging him toward darkness that had nothing to do with the nightmare sea. His last thought before the world faded was a number: one.

One debt owed. One unknown favor promised. One chance spent.

He had a feeling it wouldn't be the last.
