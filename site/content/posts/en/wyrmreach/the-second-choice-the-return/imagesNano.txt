1. filename: movement-in-the-darkness.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]. Rigid and listening, ears twitching, eyes locked on the dark beyond. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Knife grip white-knuckled, breath held, stance braced at the threshold. [Face_Reference: Elion]. Staggering and hollow-eyed, shoulders slumped, dragging a heavy provision pack that scrapes stone. After the long hungry wait, Elion lurches back into the cave with supplies, the pack trailing like an anchor across wet volcanic glass at the mouth. Cold cyan ceiling phosphorescence backlights the figures and turns the floor into black mirrors; a brief blue-white Beacon pulse adds a hard rim on knuckles and pack straps, bouncing as tiny specular points across condensation and glossy obsidian. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: elion-returns-wrecked.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He looked worse than Drusniel had imagined possible.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Skin greyed with fever, eyes emptied, lips cracked; hands shaking as he keeps moving. He staggers into the cave in lurching steps, sweat slick on face and neck, dragging the improvised pack behind him as if each scrape costs another breath. Cyan phosphorescence skims wet skin and throws sharp specular highlights on sweat beads; deep shadows pool under cheekbones and the entrance darkness swallows the background while reflections flicker on glossy obsidian. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-catches-him.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The shapeshifter collapsed.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Knees buckling, eyes rolling, body giving out mid-step. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Shock and urgency, jaw clenched, arms outstretched to catch him. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Focused and fast, already tearing at straps. Elion collapses at the threshold and Drusniel catches him while Srietz rips the provision pack open, the first smell of food spilling into air that has tasted like wet rock for a day. Cold cyan cave glow throws hard highlights on slick obsidian and wet skin; a Beacon pulse adds brief blue-white edge-light on hands in motion and bounces as tiny specular points across water droplets. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in hands, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: provisions-spread-on-the-floor.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Srietz sat back on his heels, surrounded by the supplies Elion had brought.")
prompt:Still life of hard-won provisions spilled across the obsidian floor: preserved meat wrapped in hide, small sacks of grain, dried fruit, water containers, crude bundles of herbs and medicine; grit and moisture cling to everything. Cyan ceiling phosphorescence turns the volcanic glass floor into black mirrors, producing crisp specular highlights along container edges and deep shadow between items, with faint ghost reflections shimmering in the polish. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: water-and-new-trust.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel held it to Elion's lips, forcing small sips past the shapeshifter's barely-responsive mouth.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Unconscious, breathing shallow and rapid, face slick with sweat. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Gentleness under strain, hands steady as he forces tiny sips. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Conflicted calculation, watching and recalculating trust in silence. Elion lies propped against obsidian that holds faint residual warmth while Drusniel tips a small container to his lips; Srietz hovers near stacked supplies and keeps one eye on the cave mouth. Cold cyan phosphorescence paints soft top-light over faces and wet stone; occasional blue-white Beacon reflections flicker across water and knuckles like brief signals. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
