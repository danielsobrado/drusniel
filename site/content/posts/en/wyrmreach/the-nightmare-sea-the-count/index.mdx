# Chapter 9.2 | The Count

Drusniel reached for his air magic again.

The working came reluctantly, like pulling thread through tar. The artifact against his chest seemed to pulse harder, fighting him, but desperation was a fuel that burned through resistance. A thin stream of breathable air formed around his face—not a bubble, not properly, just a current that didn't belong here, forced into existence by will alone.

It tasted thin. Metallic. Wrong in a way he couldn't name.

He breathed it anyway.

*Thirty seconds*, his mind calculated. *Maybe forty if I'm careful.*

The thing below him had stopped moving. That was worse than if it had attacked. Its attention remained fixed on him, vast and patient, but it made no move to close the distance. As if it knew something he didn't. As if it was waiting for the inevitable.

Drusniel tried to orient himself. Up should be where the light came from, but the light came from everywhere. Down should be where the pressure increased, but the pressure was wrong—heavier from above, lighter from below, as if the sea itself was inverted.

He picked a direction. It was as good as any other.

His arms cut through the water—except when they didn't. The liquid's density kept shifting, thick as honey one moment, thin as air the next. His strokes accomplished nothing he could measure. He might have moved ten feet. He might have moved ten inches. The numbers refused to behave.

*Twenty-three seconds of air remaining.*

He tried not to count. Counting had always been his anchor, his way of imposing order on chaos. But counting required things to stay still long enough to be counted, and nothing here obeyed that basic rule.

His water affinity stirred.

Drusniel crushed it down immediately. The memory of what had happened when he'd touched the sea magically was still fresh—that sudden, absolute attention from below. His air magic announced his presence like a whisper. His water magic would announce it like a scream.

But the instinct was strong. Water was everywhere. His training told him to control it, to use the currents, to find the flow and ride it to safety. His training was wrong. His training had been built for a world that made sense.

*Fourteen seconds.*

The air working was failing. The artifact's suppression pressed down on it, and Drusniel's own reserves were draining fast. He'd already used one working to buy himself this reprieve. Two more remaining, maybe three if he pushed past the point of safety.

He kicked harder. The water resisted, then didn't, then resisted again. His progress was impossible to measure.

Something brushed against his foot.

Drusniel's heart lurched, but when he looked down—or what he thought was down—there was nothing. Just black water extending into black nothing. The thing that had touched him was gone, or had never been there, or was still there but hidden in a way that defied sight.

*Seven seconds.*

He needed to think. He was good at thinking. Zaelar had praised his analytical mind, his ability to find patterns where others saw only chaos. But there were no patterns here. There was only wrongness layered on wrongness, physics that didn't function, magic that fought against him, and something ancient waiting in the depths.

The air ran out.

The last of his working dissolved, and the sea rushed in to fill the space. Not water—whatever this substance was, it wasn't truly water—but something that filled his mouth and nose and pressed against the back of his throat like a living thing seeking entrance.

Drusniel forced himself not to panic. Panic was death. Panic meant thrashing, meant using energy he didn't have, meant drawing more attention from below. He clamped his mouth shut and held what air remained in his lungs, but his lungs were burning already, and the burn was getting worse.

He reached for his magic.

The second working came even harder than the first. The artifact seemed to recognize what he was doing now, seemed to push back with deliberate force. But Drusniel pushed harder. Not much choice in that.

Air formed. Barely. A thin membrane of breathable atmosphere clinging to his face like a second skin. He gasped it in, and the gasp was too loud, too desperate, using too much too fast.

*Thirty seconds. Maybe.*

Below him, the vast presence stirred again. It had noticed the new working. Of course it had. Each use of magic was a beacon, and he was lighting them one after another like a fool marking a trail.

But what choice did he have? Don't use magic and drown. Use magic and be found. The math didn't offer a third option.

Drusniel's mind ran the calculation again, searching for variables he'd missed. Distance to shore: unknown. Current position: unknown. Direction of travel: unknown. Air reserves: two workings remaining, possibly three. Time per working: thirty seconds, maybe less as his strength failed. Total remaining time: ninety seconds, optimistically.

The shore was somewhere. It had to be. The nightmare sea was a crossing, not a prison. Things crossed it. Things survived it. Zaelar had sent him here, which meant Zaelar believed he could make it.

*Zaelar believed a lot of things*, a dark voice whispered. *Zaelar wasn't here.*

The water pressed in from all sides. His air working was weakening already, the artifact grinding against it, his own fatigue making the magic slippery and thin. He kicked and pulled and forced himself forward, and the sea gave him nothing in return.

*Twenty seconds.*

His lungs burned. His muscles screamed. His magic felt like a guttering candle in a hurricane, barely alive, barely useful, draining faster than it should.

The thing below moved.

Not toward him. Sideways. Circling, maybe. Getting a better angle. Or losing interest. Drusniel couldn't tell, and not knowing was almost worse than certainty.

*Twelve seconds.*

He tried to count strokes. Three, four, five—

Five happened, and five happened again, and then there was no five at all, just a gap where the number should have been, and Drusniel's mind lurched at the wrongness of it.

Time wasn't just broken here. Time was *hostile*.

The air ran out again.

This time, he didn't have enough left to scream.
