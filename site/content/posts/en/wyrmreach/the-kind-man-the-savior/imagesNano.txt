1. filename: tarp-shelter-after-the-crossing.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: half-awake pain, breath shallow. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: unsentimental focus, stirring steadily. Under a rough canvas tarp shelter on a black-sand coast, Merrik tends a small driftwood fire and a battered pot while Drusniel lies on makeshift bedding; ash-scented wind flaps the tarp edge and red-grey twilight stains the shoreline beyond. Firelight is the key source: warm orange flicker throws interactive highlights onto the dented pot and the underside of faces, ember reflections dancing on varnished wood and wet metal; cold red-grey ambient from outside adds a thin rim along the canvas seam and drops the far shore into muted haze. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: small-sips-of-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He drank slowly, letting each sip settle before taking the next.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: strained swallow, eyes unfocused, fighting nausea. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: practical concentration, grip firm but controlled as he measures the pace. Tight close-up under the tarp as Merrik holds a waterskin to Drusniel’s mouth and forces slow, careful sips; the fire crackles nearby and the world outside stays wrong-colored twilight. Firelight from below warms lips and knuckles in uneven pulses, orange highlights catching pores and the wet edge of the waterskin; tarp shadow keeps the background near-black while faint red-grey ambient leaks at the shelter mouth as cool edge fill. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dented-pot-and-thick-broth.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He was lying on something softer than sand, and when he turned his head, he saw Merrik crouched by a small fire, stirring something in a battered pot.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro detail of a dented metal pot over a small driftwood fire, thick broth bubbling slowly with meat and unfamiliar herbs; ash and sulfur haze hangs in the tarp-shadowed air, steam curling and ember sparks rising and dying fast. Fire is the only strong light source: warm orange from below creates oily highlights on the broth surface and specular points along the pot dents, reflections bending through heat shimmer; beyond the flame, everything falls into soot-dark with faint red-grey twilight barely outlining the tarp edge. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: protected-drow-mage.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The world tilted, settled, tilted again.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: urgency overriding dizziness, pushing up on one elbow. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: neutral mask with a flicker of recognition. Steam from the pot drifts between them as Drusniel speaks the name Szoravel under the canvas shelter; the black shore and a beached boat are implied through the tarp opening and ash wind. Firelight from low camera-right throws warm uplight that catches steam and the edge of Drusniel’s cheek; cold red-grey twilight leaks in as side fill, flattening distant sand and turning shadows cool at the edges. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: debt-and-questions.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "In his chest, the debt waited.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: sleepless calculation under exhaustion, one hand pressed to his chest as if testing a second weight beneath his ribs. Alone on the makeshift bedding under the tarp, listening to the fire and ash wind while the wrong twilight stains the shore outside. Thin warm firelight grazes fingers and the edge of his face from below, interactive orange highlights catching knuckle ridges; red-grey ambient from outside outlines the tarp seam and leaves the rest in soft shadow, background dropping into near-black. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
