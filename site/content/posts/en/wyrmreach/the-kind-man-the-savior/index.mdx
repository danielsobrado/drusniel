## Chapter 11 | Part 1

--- 

Consciousness returned slowly, like light filtering through dark water.

Warmth first—not the volcanic heat of the sand, but something softer. A fire nearby, crackling gently. Then smell: cooking meat, herbs he didn't recognize, the faint sulfur undertone that seemed to permeate everything in this place. Then pain: every muscle aching, his throat raw, his magic a hollow emptiness where fullness should have been.

Drusniel opened his eyes.

The sky above was still wrong—that perpetual twilight of red-tinged grey—but there was a rough canvas stretched over him, providing shade. He was lying on something softer than sand, and when he turned his head, he saw Merrik crouched by a small fire, stirring something in a battered pot.

"Awake." The man's voice was matter-of-fact, unsurprised. "Good. Thought you might sleep another day."

"How long?" Drusniel's voice came out as a croak, barely audible.

"Two days since I found you on the beach. You've been in and out—mostly out." Merrik stood, moving with the practiced efficiency Drusniel had noted before, and brought a waterskin to his lips. "Small sips. The crossing takes everything out of you. Try to drink too fast and you'll just bring it back up."

The water was warm and tasted faintly of minerals, but it was the most welcome thing Drusniel had ever felt. He drank slowly, letting each sip settle before taking the next.

"Thank you." The words felt inadequate, but they were all he had.

Merrik shrugged. "You were alive. Some of them aren't. Seemed a waste to let you die after you'd already survived the hard part."

"The crossing."

"The nightmare sea, the locals call it. Not many make it across. The ones who do..." He gave Drusniel an assessing look. "They're usually different afterward. Changed."

The debt.

Drusniel could feel it still—that hook in his chest, that weight of an owed favor. It hadn't faded with sleep. If anything, it felt more present now, more real. Whatever he had accepted in the darkness of the sea, it hadn't been a dream.

"I need to find someone," he said, pushing himself up on one elbow. The world tilted, settled, tilted again. "A mage named Szoravel."

Merrik's expression didn't change, but something flickered behind his eyes. Recognition, quickly hidden. "Szoravel. You mentioned the name before, when you were delirious. The drow mage."

"You know him?"

"Know of him. Everyone does, in these parts. He's... notable." Merrik returned to his fire, stirring the pot with a wooden spoon. "Protected, they say. Has some arrangement with the powers in the eastern territories. Not the kind of person you approach without an introduction."

Drusniel filed the information away. Protected. Arrangements. Eastern territories. Nothing useful yet, but pieces of a pattern he might eventually understand.

"How do I find him?"

"Rest first. You're in no condition to find anyone." Merrik ladled something from the pot into a bowl—broth, thick and fragrant, with chunks of meat floating in it. "Eat. Sleep. In a few days, when you can stand without falling over, we can talk about getting you where you need to go."

It was sensible advice. Drusniel's body agreed with it even as his mind chafed at the delay. He couldn't afford to wait. The instructions Zaelar had given him were specific: find Szoravel, deliver the message. Every moment spent recovering was a moment something could go wrong.

But he couldn't deliver anything if he collapsed before reaching his destination.

"You're very helpful," he said, accepting the bowl. The broth was hot, strange-tasting, but nourishing. "For someone who found a stranger on a beach."

Merrik's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "The shores here are generous with strangers. I've found my share over the years. Help the ones I can, bury the ones I can't." He shrugged. "Call it professional habit."

"Professional?"

"I work these coasts. Salvage, mostly. Things wash up—cargo from ships that shouldn't exist, artifacts from places no one remembers, and sometimes people." He gestured vaguely toward the nightmare sea, invisible beyond the canvas shelter. "The crossing spits out survivors now and then. Some of them are grateful. Some of them have skills worth knowing. And some of them..." He looked at Drusniel again with that assessing gaze. "Some of them are valuable in ways they don't realize."

The words hung in the air. Drusniel's exhausted mind tried to parse them for threat, for warning, but found nothing concrete. Just a man stating facts, offering help, asking for nothing in return.

That should have felt reassuring. Instead, it felt like a question he didn't know how to answer.

"Rest," Merrik said again. "We'll talk more when you're stronger."

Drusniel lay back on the makeshift bedding, bowl of broth warming his hands. Above him, the canvas flapped gently in a wind that smelled of ash and distant fire. Beyond it, the sky remained wrong, a constant reminder that he was far from anything he knew.

In his chest, the debt waited. Silent. Patient.

He closed his eyes and tried not to count the questions multiplying in his mind.

*Eleven*, his mind supplied anyway. *Merrik asked eleven questions in one conversation.*

The number felt significant. He was too tired to understand why.
