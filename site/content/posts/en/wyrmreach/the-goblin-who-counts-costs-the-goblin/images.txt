1. filename: srietz-appears-from-nowhere.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, sudden intrusion; Srietz crouches low with wide calculating eyes and both hands raised, palms out, while Drusniel's hand drifts toward casting and Elion shifts between them with a stance ready for violence. At the edge of a dense treeline, Srietz appears beside a basalt rock formation where there was nothing a heartbeat ago; behind him the markers on bark and stone feel deliberate, and shrill hunting screams echo closer through the trunks. Dim overcast daylight filters through canopy and ash haze, giving cold grey fill; wet bark and stone catch small hard highlights, and the deeper woods behind Srietz fall into darker layers where movement can hide. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in drifting grit. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: exchange-not-trust.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Srietz does not ask for trust.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Photorealistic, fast-talking pragmatism; eyes darting as he refuses trust and insists on trade, palms held steady and open like a contract offered under threat. Tight portrait beside the rock line, breath controlled, listening past Drusniel and Elion toward the next shriek; flecks of grit cling to his sleeves and fingers as if he hit the ground hard to appear here. Cold overcast daylight gives flat grey fill, but a paler break in the canopy drops a thin highlight across one cheek and his raised hands, while dark basalt returns a cool bounce that lifts the shadow side without warming it. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, natural skin with pores, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: vextrath-territory-marks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "This is Vexrath's territory.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of rough tree bark gouged with fresh claw-like marks and deliberate warning symbols, the sign of claimed territory; sap beads at torn fibers and damp moss grips the base like bruising. The surrounding undergrowth trembles as multiple shrill cries echo between trunks, hinting at hunters moving unseen just out of frame. Diffuse overcast daylight from above makes the scene cold and flat, while wet sap and exposed wood catch tiny hard specular points; deeper shadows between roots stay dense, hiding motion. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: your-decision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The math was ugly but clear.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, decision under pressure; Elion's glance asks for the call, Drusniel answers with a small decisive nod, and Srietz watches with hard negotiator patience that turns instantly into movement. Tight three-shot among crooked trunks and basalt spurs as the shrieks multiply beyond them; Srietz shifts his weight to run, already half-turned toward a path that looks like every other path. Cold overcast daylight provides flat grey fill, but the gaps between trunks swallow detail into layered shadow; brief highlights catch on wet bark and grit as if the forest is blinking. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: run-they-are-coming.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Now run.")
prompt:Photorealistic, motion-heavy shot as Srietz leads Drusniel and Elion into the forest at a run, boots tearing through black volcanic grit and leaf litter; the path repeats and twists, making speed feel like another trap. The woods behind them vibrate with approaching shrieks, and the urgency reads in hunched shoulders, hard angles, and thrown weight more than in faces. Dim overcast daylight filters through canopy and haze, flattening the scene into cold greys while wet bark flashes with quick highlights as they pass; the background smears into streaked trunks and stone edges. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
