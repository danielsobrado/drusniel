1. filename: srietz-appears-from-nowhere.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Srietz: wide calculating stare; both hands raised, palms out, crouched low. Drusniel: hand drifting toward casting, posture tense but controlled. Elion: stepping between them, ready for violence. At the edge of a dense treeline, Srietz appears beside a basalt rock formation where there was nothing a heartbeat ago; bark and stone behind him carry deliberate markers and the hunting shrieks are closer. Dim overcast daylight filtered through canopy and ash haze gives cold grey fill; wet bark ridges and basalt micro-pits catch small hard specular points, and the deeper woods behind Srietz fall into stacked dark layers that swallow detail. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in drifting grit. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: exchange-not-trust.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Srietz does not ask for trust.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . Fast-talking pragmatism; eyes darting, palms held steady and open like a contract offered under threat. Tight portrait beside the rock line, listening past Drusniel and Elion toward the next shriek; grit clings to sleeves and fingers as if he hit the ground hard to appear here. Cold overcast daylight gives flat grey fill; a paler break in the canopy drops a thin highlight across one cheek and his raised hands, while dark basalt returns a cool bounce that lifts the shadow side without warming it, with specular points catching on damp grit and skin moisture. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: vextrath-territory-marks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "This is Vexrath's territory.")
prompt:Macro close-up of rough tree bark gouged with fresh claw-like marks and deliberate warning symbols; torn fibrous wood strands and sap beads make it feel newly cut, damp moss clinging at the base. Undergrowth trembles as shrill cries echo between trunks, hinting at hunters moving unseen. Diffuse overcast daylight from above makes the scene cold and flat; wet sap holds sharp specular highlights, exposed wood pores show texture, and shadow pockets between roots stay dense while returning a faint cool bounce onto the underside of the gouges. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: your-decision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The math was ugly but clear.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Elion: glance asking for the call, shoulders tight. Drusniel: small decisive nod, jaw set. Srietz: hard negotiator patience turning instantly into motion. Tight three-shot among crooked trunks and basalt spurs as the shrieks multiply; Srietz shifts weight to run, already half-turned toward a path that looks like every other path. Cold overcast daylight provides flat grey fill; quick highlights flash on wet bark and gritty basalt grains, while the gaps between trunks swallow detail into layered shadow with no clean horizon for the eye to anchor on. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: run-they-are-coming.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Now run.")
prompt:Motion-heavy wide shot as Srietz leads Drusniel and Elion into the forest at a run, boots tearing through black volcanic grit and leaf litter; the path repeats and twists, making speed feel like another trap. The woods behind them vibrate with approaching shrieks, urgency carried in thrown weight, hunched shoulders, and hard angles. Dim overcast daylight filtered through canopy and haze flattens the scene into cold greys; wet bark flashes with quick specular highlights as they pass, grit sprays into the air catching tiny points of light, and the background smears into streaked trunks and stone edges. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
