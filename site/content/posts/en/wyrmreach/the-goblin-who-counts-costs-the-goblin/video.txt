## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Srietz surges forward and the other two match him; boots skid on loose grit and then find purchase, accelerating into a full sprint. The treeline behind them ripples with quick movement that refuses to resolve into a clear shape.
[00:03-00:05] A shriek snaps closer and splits into overlapping calls; something darts between trunks out of focus and the undergrowth shudders as if pressed down by passing weight. Srietz cuts a hard angle without looking back.
[00:05-00:08] The path seems to repeat, forcing a choice; Drusniel checks his pace for a half-beat and then commits, following Srietz through the tightest gap. Elion stays tight to his shoulder, and the screams fall in behind them like a net tightening.

Handheld.
Audio: rapid footfalls on volcanic grit, branch snap, cloth and leather creak, harsh layered shrieks, a low hiss rising under the calls, heavy breathing, brief stone scrape as someone stumbles and recovers. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
