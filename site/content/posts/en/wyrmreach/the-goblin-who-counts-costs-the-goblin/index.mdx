# Chapter 15.2 | The Goblin

The goblin appeared from nowhere.

One moment the treeline was empty except for the shapes moving through it. The next, a small green-grey figure was crouching beside a rock formation, eyes wide and calculating.

"Srietz sees you are lost," it said. "Srietz sees you are also hunted. These things, they are related."

Drusniel's hand moved toward his magic, that thin trickle of power. Elion moved between them, stance shifting into something ready for violence.

"Wait." The goblin's hands went up, palms out. "Srietz is not threat. Srietz is also hunted. Srietz is also lost. Srietz thinks maybe lost people work together better than alone."

"Why should we trust you?" Drusniel asked.

"Trust?" The goblin—Srietz—made a sound that might have been laughter. "Srietz does not ask for trust. Trust is expensive. Srietz asks for trade. Srietz knows where you are. Srietz knows what hunts you. Srietz knows how to not die here." He pointed at Drusniel, then Elion. "You are strong. You are fast. You can protect while Srietz guides."

Another shriek echoed through the trees, closer now.

"What hunts us?" Elion demanded.

"Coatly." Srietz's voice dropped. "Vexrath's creatures. They hunt by sound, by magic, by anything that doesn't belong. You—" he pointed at Drusniel "—you have magic. They can smell it. You—" pointing at Elion "—you are wrong in ways Srietz does not understand. They can smell that too."

"You know Vexrath?"

Something flickered across the goblin's face. Fear, quickly suppressed. "Srietz knows Vexrath. Srietz worked for Vexrath. Srietz left Vexrath's service without permission." He gestured at the markers on the trees. "This is Vexrath's territory. Srietz should not be here. You should not be here. But here we all are."

The shrieks were multiplying. Three. Five. More.

"What's your offer?" Drusniel asked, because time was running out and bad options were better than no options.

"Simple trade. Srietz guides. You protect. We leave Vexrath's territory together. After that—" he shrugged "—Srietz goes where Srietz wants. You go where you want. Fair trade. Clean trade."

Elion looked at Drusniel. His expression said nothing, but somehow Drusniel understood: *Your call.*

*Three options,* his mind calculated. *Fight alone against unknown enemies. Run blind through hostile territory. Or accept help from a goblin who freely admits he's fleeing the same threat.*

The math was ugly but clear.

"Take me with you." Srietz's voice had lost its calculated edge. "That's all. Srietz doesn't ask for much. Just not to die here."

"Lead," Drusniel said. "But if you betray us—"

"Betrayal is bad business." Srietz was already moving. "Srietz is good at business. Now run. They're coming."
