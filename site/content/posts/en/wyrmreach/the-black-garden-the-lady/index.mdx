## Chapter 21 | Part 4

--- 

The conversation lasted two hours.

Nyxara asked questions the way a surgeon uses a scalpel: precisely, deliberately, cutting away layers to see what lay beneath. She asked about Umbra'kor. About the surface. About how a drow came to have air affinity when every drow mage she'd encountered in thirty years worked shadow or earth.

Drusniel answered carefully. Partial truths. Deflections that sounded like answers. He told her about the Duskborn Trials without mentioning the sabotage. About Wyrmreach without mentioning the Voice. About Szoravel without explaining why.

She let him deflect. That was the dangerous part. She didn't push. She simply noted each evasion, cataloged it, and moved on. Building a map of what he wouldn't say that was probably more valuable than what he would.

"You carry something," she said.

It wasn't a question.

"Everyone carries something."

"Not like this." Nyxara touched the rim of her cup. "When you entered my territory, the flowers turned. They turn for magic, for power, for things that interest me. But they turned *hard* for you. All of them. At once. That's new."

Drusniel kept his face still. The Beacon sat in his pack, silent for once, as if it knew to be quiet in the presence of something that might notice it.

"I'm a mage," he said. "Magic interests your flowers."

"Magic is common here. The contested lands overflow with it. My flowers have seen mages, alchemists, priests, and creatures that defy categorization. They don't turn for common magic." She paused. "They turn for old things. Things that remember what this land was before the lords carved it up."

He said nothing.

"Keep your secrets," she said. "For now. Secrets are currency in the contested lands, and I prefer my investments to appreciate rather than be spent."

The conversation shifted. Nyxara laid out the geography between her territory and Szoravel's position: four days of travel through lands that belonged to no one and everyone. The gap between the three lords' territories, unpoliced and unstable. Things lived there that had been pushed out of all three domains. Predators without masters. Magic without rules.

"You won't survive it alone," she said.

"We've survived this far."

"This far has been the easy part." She said it without mockery, which made it worse. "Srietz knows. Ask him later, when you're alone. Ask him what lives in the gaps."

Drusniel looked at Srietz. The goblin's ears were nearly flat against his skull.

"I don't need your permission to cross your territory," Drusniel said. "We're already here."

"Yes. And I could have left you with arrows in your chest. Instead, I offered tea." Nyxara stood. The flowers behind her parted again, creating a path that hadn't existed a moment before. "I'm not asking for gratitude. I'm offering a structure. Travel through my lands under my protection. My scouts guide you. My resources supply you. In exchange, you work for me when I need you. Simple tasks. Nothing that conflicts with your journey to Szoravel."

"What kind of tasks?"

"The kind that require someone with your particular abilities. Air magic is rare here. The other lords don't have it. I'd like to keep that advantage."

The offer was clean and clear and held the precise weight of a trap designed by someone who understood that the best traps didn't look like traps at all. They looked like reasonable propositions.

Drusniel thought about the alternatives. The volcanic shelf behind them, impassable without supplies. Vorthrak's territory to the north, where strength was the only currency and they had none to spare. Sytherix to the south, where the rumors were worse than Vorthrak's reality. And the uncontrolled gap between territories, where Srietz's silence spoke volumes about what waited.

"My companions stay with me," Drusniel said. "As a group. We're not separated."

"I wouldn't dream of it." Nyxara's smile returned. "A mage, a shapeshifter, and an alchemist who's survived the contested lands before? I'd be a fool to break up that collection."

Collection. Not team. Not group. Collection.

Drusniel heard the word and filed it away.

"We accept," he said, because refusing was dying and he'd done enough of that.

"Wise." Nyxara turned to leave, then paused. She looked back at Drusniel, and the calculation in her face had given way to curiosity. Genuine curiosity, which was far more dangerous.

"One more thing," she said. "A drow with air magic, traveling to Szoravel, carrying something old enough to make my flowers sing. You're not the first interesting thing to pass through my territory. But you might be the most interesting thing this year."

She walked into the flowers and the petals closed behind her, swallowing her like water swallowing a stone. Within seconds, there was no trace she'd been there at all.

Varesh materialized at the edge of the clearing.

"Quarters have been prepared," the scout leader said. "You'll rest tonight. Tomorrow, a guide will be assigned for your journey through Lady Nyxara's territory."

"A guide," Drusniel said flatly.

"A guide." Varesh's tone left no room for misinterpretation. "Lady Nyxara is generous with her protection. She prefers to ensure her investments are... observed."

They were led to a structure built within the flower field itself, walls woven from thick stems, floor covered in dried petals that crunched underfoot. It was comfortable, supplied, and completely exposed to anyone who knew how to listen through the flowers.

A gilded cage, except the gilding was black and the cage smelled like chemicals.
