1. filename: nyxara-questions-like-a-blade.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Nyxara] Leaning in slightly, voice implied by surgical calm; eyes still, patience sharpened into curiosity. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Face held perfectly still under scrutiny, jaw set, answers measured and incomplete. Intimate table scene in the crystal clearing: untouched tea steams between them, the air tastes chemical and the low hum of the field sits like pressure behind the teeth; crystal facets behind Nyxara angle inward like a congregation. Cold violet refraction bends subtly toward her and outlines her shoulders while low orange fissure-glow from hairline cracks uplights cup steam and knuckles, halation blooming along crystal edges. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: flowers-turn-toward-his-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Nyxara touched the rim of her cup.")
prompt:Ground-level detail beside the table: a patch of tough low red flowers and thick dark stems rotates as if tracking, petals and stamen turning hard toward a worn travel pack at a seated traveler’s feet; the motion is subtle but unanimous, like a field aligning to a magnet. Chemical haze clings close to the ground, black crystal needles loom around the clearing, and damp grit sticks to petals. Violet refraction flickers across wet petal surfaces and stem varnish while a low orange underglow from hairline cracks adds warm edge light under petals, dust motes flashing amber as they drift. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Ektar 100, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: nyxara-leaves-through-flowers.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The flowers behind her parted again, creating a path that hadn't existed a moment before.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Nyxara] Turning away mid-offer, unhurried, certainty in every step. She walks into the flower field as the blooms behind her part to create a path that didn’t exist a moment before; thick stems split and petals lift like a living curtain, then begin closing as she passes, swallowing her silhouette like water swallowing stone. The air remains perfectly still and chemical, dried petals and grit barely shifting as the field moves around her. Violet refraction glints along wet petal edges while low orange fissure-glow warms the underside of the closing blooms, mixed light blooming into soft halation in the haze. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in petals, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: varesh-announces-the-guide.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Varesh materialized at the edge of the clearing.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varesh] Formal posture, controlled expression, authority delivered without raising his voice. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Listening without inflection, eyes flat and calculating. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Ears nearly flat, silent, watching. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Hovering behind, arms crossed, ready to move. Varesh materializes at the edge of the clearing as if stepping out of the crystal field, the meaning clear in his stance: a guide will be assigned, and they will be observed. Violet refraction from nearby facets draws cold edge highlights along armor and cheekbones while orange underglow from fissures adds harsh uplight under jaws, chemical haze blooming the contrast. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: quarters-in-the-flower-field.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "They were led to a structure built within the flower field itself, walls woven from thick stems, floor covered in dried petals that crunched underfoot.")
prompt:Interior of a makeshift shelter built inside the flower field: walls woven from thick dark stems, floor covered in dried petals that crunch underfoot, supplies arranged with deliberate neatness to look generous; gaps between stems reveal surrounding blooms like a living surveillance net. The space feels comfortable but exposed, a gilded cage where the gilding is black and the air smells faintly chemical. Warm flicker from a single shaded lantern inside catches on petal edges and woven stems, while faint violet refraction from outside blooms leaks through gaps and paints cold highlights on the floor; deep shadows pool behind the weave. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignette, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
