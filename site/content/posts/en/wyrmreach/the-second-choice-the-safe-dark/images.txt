1. filename: safe-dark-obsidian-caves.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Jaw set, eyes scanning; hands busy counting what little remains. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Clinical stare, damp fingers, crouched low near the dripping seam. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Collapsed against the wall, trembling, breath shallow and fast. Three exhausted travelers huddle deep inside obsidian caves where sound feels swallowed, surrounded by black-glass walls and a ceiling dusted with faint phosphorescent growth; they have no provisions, only moisture on the stone and the knowledge the dark is safer than outside but still a trap. The ceiling's cold cyan-green phosphorescence provides weak top-light that skims wet obsidian facets, while the Beacon's intermittent blue-white pulse leaks through cloth and throws brief hard reflections across droplets and cheekbones. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: srietz-tests-the-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The goblin ran a finger along the obsidian, brought it to his lips.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Lips pressed, eyes focused; finger wet with condensation. He drags a fingertip along wet obsidian, lifts it to his tongue, then nods once as if confirming mineral water is drinkable; droplets bead on black-glass crystal and smear under the touch. Weak ceiling phosphorescence casts cold overhead glow that turns moisture into razor specular streaks, and the Beacon's pulse adds brief blue-white glints reflected as tiny points in the wet surface. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: elion-exhausted-after-partial-changes.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He'd collapsed against the cave wall the moment they'd stopped running, his breathing shallow and fast.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Slumped, shaking, breath short and fast after shifting; hands clenched, eyes unfocused. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Worry held back, gaze steady, posture protective without moving closer. Elion trembles against the obsidian wall after the escape, while Drusniel watches in silence inside the cramped black-glass passage where every surface reflects weak light like broken mirrors. Cold phosphorescence from the ceiling paints cyan edges on skin and wet stone, and a soft blue-white pulse from the Beacon throws intermittent highlights across Elion's trembling hands and the wall behind him. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: the-beacon-points-northeast.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The Beacon pulsed against his chest, hot through the fabric, pointing northeast like it always did.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Eyes wide and sleepless, jaw tight; one hand hovering near his chest without touching. He sits in the dark and listens as the Beacon pulses hot through cloth against him, gaze fixed toward a northeast tunnel mouth as if the direction has weight; condensation ticks on obsidian and the cave feels patient and indifferent. The Beacon's cold blue-white glow is the primary light, spilling up onto chin and knuckles in rhythmic bursts, while faint ceiling phosphorescence adds a thin cyan fill that turns the obsidian reflections into ghosted duplicates. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: condensation-is-survival.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel counted their assets in the darkness: three people, no supplies, no food, water only if the moisture on the walls could be collected.")
prompt:Photorealistic survival macro; condensation gathers into fat droplets on heat-fractured obsidian and drips into a crude improvised container, each drop catching the ceiling's faint phosphorescence like a tiny signal and splashing into silence. The ceiling's cold cyan glow and occasional blue pulse reflections create sharp specular highlights on wet stone and deep falloff into black between droplets. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
