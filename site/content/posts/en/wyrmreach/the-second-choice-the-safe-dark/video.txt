## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A slow pulse of heat builds under Drusniel's shirt; he inhales, counts three beats, and forces his hands to stay on his knees while condensation taps the floor in uneven rhythm.
[00:03-00:05] Srietz crawls to a wet seam and wrings a cloth into a chipped cup; Elion coughs once, then clamps a hand over his mouth as the blue glow flares and throws sharp reflections across the obsidian.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel turns his head toward the northeast tunnel, shifts his weight to stand, boot scraping for traction, then freezes as distant stone ticks; the pulse settles back to a patient throb.

Dolly in.
Audio: water drips, cloth scrape, boot scuff on obsidian, shallow breathing, a single cough, faint low hum from the Beacon, distant rock tick. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
