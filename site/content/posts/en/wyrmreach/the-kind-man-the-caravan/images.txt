1. filename: slaver-caravan-arrives.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, cold crystalline clarity hitting at once; jaw set, eyes narrowed, body still weak but locked into focus. [Face_Reference: Merrik] Easy smile unchanged, calm posture with total leverage. Three heavy reinforced wagons roll onto the black-sand coast and brake hard near the tarp shelter; guards spread out with practiced precision while iron-bar cages bolted to the wagon beds flash in lantern light, some occupied, turning the camp into a revealed trap. Red-grey twilight from the ash-stained sky provides flat, dead fill, while wagon lanterns and the shelter fire throw warm amber flicker across iron bars, harness leather, and faces with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the nearest wheel, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: iron-cage-on-wagon.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Iron-barred cages bolted to the wagon beds, some of them occupied.")
prompt:Photorealistic close-up on an iron-bar cage bolted to a reinforced wagon bed: thick rivets, scraped metal, hairline rust at seams, and a locked hinge polished by repeated use; a prisoner sits in shadow with fingers curled around the bars as guards' boots and weapon belts pass in soft blur behind. A swaying oil lantern on the wagon throws warm orange stripes across the iron and catches tiny specular points on rivet heads, while cold red-grey twilight washes the background flat. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: merrik-never-lied.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel should have heard it for what it was.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik] Photorealistic, smile held too smoothly; eyes flat with economics. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Fury controlled into calculation; breath shallow, gaze pinned on Merrik as the last assumption dies. Tight two-shot at the shelter mouth as Merrik calmly names cargo and value; behind them, guards fan out and the iron cages sit half in frame like evidence, transforming the fire and canvas into a lure. Firelight from low center frame warms one side of each face and throws amber highlights on lips and knuckles, while wagon lanterns add streaked reflections on iron and the red-grey sky fills the shadows cold. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin texture visible, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: led-to-the-second-wagon.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The guards were close now.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, resigned restraint; eyes hard, shoulders heavy, conserving strength by refusing to flinch. Guards close in and steer him toward the open cage on the second wagon, hands firm at his arms and back; iron bars frame the destination like a mouth as boots crunch black sand and harnesses creak. Lantern light from the wagon casts warm amber bands across the bars and moving hands, while the red-grey twilight fills the rest of the frame flat and merciless. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur on a guard hand, subtle lens flare from the lantern. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: caged-and-rolling-east.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "As the wagon began to move, he looked back at Merrik's camp—the shelter that had felt like safety, the fire that had seemed like kindness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, jaw tight as he forces calm; hands white on the bars, eyes fixed on the shelter receding. From inside the cage as the wagon lurches forward, Drusniel grips iron bars and looks back at Merrik's tarp shelter shrinking behind the churned ruts; the campfire and canvas read as bait now, ash haze trailing the wheels as the caravan rolls east along the dead coast. Cold red-grey twilight dominates, while the distant fire and wagon lanterns paint thin warm reflections along the iron bars and catch in moisture on his fingers. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vibration blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
