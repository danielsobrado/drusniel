1. filename: slaver-caravan-arrives.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: cold crystalline clarity hitting at once, jaw set, eyes narrowed, body still weak but locked into focus. [Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: easy smile unchanged, calm posture with total leverage. Three heavy reinforced wagons roll onto the black volcanic-sand coast and brake hard near the tarp shelter; guards spread out with practiced precision while iron-bar cages bolted to the wagon beds flash, some occupied, turning the camp into a revealed trap. Oil lanterns and the shelter fire are the key sources, warm amber flicker casting interactive highlights that slide along riveted iron, harness leather, and wet sand grains; red-grey twilight fills the shadows flat and dead, smoke haze catching thin beams. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around lanterns, slight motion blur in the nearest wheel. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: iron-cage-on-wagon.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Iron-barred cages bolted to the wagon beds, some of them occupied.")
prompt:Photorealistic close-up on an iron-bar cage bolted to a reinforced wagon bed: thick rivets, scraped metal, hairline rust at seams, and a locked hinge polished by repeated use; a prisoner sits in shadow with fingers curled around the bars as guards' boots and weapon belts pass in soft blur behind. A swaying oil lantern paints warm orange stripes across the iron, interactive specular points popping on rivet heads and damp grit; cold red-grey twilight washes the background matte, leaving deep shadows between bars. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: merrik-never-lied.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel should have heard it for what it was.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: smile held too smoothly, eyes flat with economics. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: fury controlled into calculation, breath shallow, gaze pinned on Merrik. Tight two-shot at the shelter mouth as Merrik calmly names cargo and value; behind them, guards fan out and iron cages sit half in frame like evidence, turning fire and canvas into a lure. Firelight from low center throws warm amber up into cheekbones and knuckle ridges; wagon lanterns add thin reflections crawling across iron and wet leather, while red-grey twilight fills the far background cold and flat. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: led-to-the-second-wagon.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The guards were close now.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: resigned restraint, eyes hard, shoulders heavy, refusing to flinch. Guards close in and steer him toward the open cage on the second wagon, hands firm at his arms and back; iron bars frame the destination like a mouth as boots crunch black sand and harnesses creak. Lantern light from the wagon casts warm amber bands that slide across moving hands and bars, catching pores and grit; red-grey twilight fills everything else flat and merciless, smoke haze softening the far edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur on a guard hand, subtle lens flare from the lantern. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: caged-and-rolling-east.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "As the wagon began to move, he looked back at Merrik's camp—the shelter that had felt like safety, the fire that had seemed like kindness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: jaw tight as he forces calm, hands white on the bars, eyes fixed on the shelter receding. From inside the cage as the wagon lurches forward, iron bars fill the foreground while Merrik's tarp shelter shrinks behind churned ruts; the campfire and canvas read as bait now, ash haze trailing the wheels as the caravan rolls east along the dead coast. Cold red-grey twilight dominates; distant fire and lanterns paint thin warm reflections along iron, interactive highlights catching on moisture on fingers and on grit embedded in the bars. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vibration blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
