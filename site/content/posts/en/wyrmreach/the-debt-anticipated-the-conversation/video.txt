## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Elion speaks. His mouth moves with measured calm, delivering weight. The campfire embers flicker, casting shifting orange light upward across both faces. Drusniel is still, listening.
[00:03-00:06] Drusniel's expression shifts — subtle, devastating. His jaw tightens. His eyes widen fractionally, then go flat. The look of someone recalculating everything they thought they knew. The ember glow pulses.
[00:06-00:08] Drusniel looks away. His hand finds the volcanic rock beside him and grips it. Elion watches him, waiting, knowing. Ash drifts between them.

Static camera, locked off. Let the faces carry the shot.
Audio: crackling embers, faint wind, distant volcanic rumble. The sound of a hand gripping stone. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy, shallow depth of field.
