## Chapter 13 | Part 5

--- 

Dawn didn't come in Wyrmreach.

But something shifted in the quality of the light—a brightening that wasn't quite morning, a change in the twilight that marked time passing even without a sun to measure it by.

Drusniel woke against a rock wall, body aching, magic depleted, alive.

Elion sat a few feet away, watching him. Hadn't slept, apparently. Or didn't need to.

"You stayed," Drusniel said.

"You came back for me." Elion's head tilted at that wrong angle. "No one's ever done that."

"You treated me like a person."

"You are a person."

The simplicity of it struck something in Drusniel's chest. Four days in that cage, and no one—not the guards, not the other prisoners, not even Merrik before the betrayal—had said anything that obvious.

*You are a person.* Such a small statement. Such an enormous thing to hear.

"What now?" Elion asked. "You had a destination. Before the caravan."

"Szoravel." The name felt distant, belonging to a plan made by someone who hadn't been sold into slavery. "A mage. I came to Wyrmreach to find him."

"I know where that is." Elion said it casually, as if the information had always been there. "East. Through the disputed lands. Past the volcanic territory. It's... far. And dangerous."

"Everything in Wyrmreach seems dangerous."

"Yes." That almost-smile. "But some dangers are worse than others."

Drusniel studied the creature—the being—who had chosen to stay with him. Grey skin, red markings, joints that bent wrong. Whatever Elion was, he wasn't human. Wasn't elven. Wasn't anything Drusniel had a name for.

"What are you?" he asked finally. "Not what the guards called you. What you actually are."

Elion was quiet for a long moment. His fingers moved against the rocky ground, tracing patterns that might have been meaningless or might have been something else entirely.

"I don't know," he said at last. "I know I can do things. Change things. Become things. But I don't know what that makes me." He met Drusniel's eyes. "I know I was born in a cage. I know I escaped, and was caught, and escaped again. I know freedom is the only thing I want badly enough to die for." A pause. "And I know you opened my cage without asking for anything in return."

"I needed a distraction."

"You could have made a distraction without freeing me. Could have set the fire and run. Could have saved yourself and left me for the eastern markets." Elion's voice was soft. "You didn't."

Drusniel didn't have an answer for that. The decision had been made in the moment, without the careful analysis his mind usually demanded. He'd seen Elion waiting, seen someone who expected nothing and had been given nothing, and he'd chosen.

"I don't know why I did it," he admitted.

"Does it matter?"

"It should. I should understand my own motivations. Should be able to—" He stopped. Laughed, a little bitterly. "I spent my whole life calculating. Measuring. Planning every move seventeen steps ahead. And then I crossed a sea that shouldn't exist, got betrayed by a man who never lied, and opened a cage because it felt like the right thing to do."

"Maybe that's enough." Elion rose, his body unfolding in ways that made Drusniel's eyes want to slide away. "Maybe the calculations aren't the point."

"Then what is?"

"Walking free." Elion extended a hand. "Together, if you want. Or alone, if you'd rather. But walking. Always walking."

Drusniel looked at the hand—grey-skinned, long-fingered, not quite human—and thought about the choice ahead. He could travel alone. He'd always traveled alone. It was safer, simpler, less complicated.

But Elion had waited for him. Had trusted him with truth about his uncertain nature. Had stayed through the night when he could have disappeared into the strange landscape.

In Wyrmreach, apparently, that counted for something.

Drusniel took the hand and let Elion pull him up.

"East," he said. "Through the disputed lands. To find a mage named Szoravel."

"East," Elion agreed. "Walking free."

Behind them, far in the distance, smoke still rose from what remained of the caravan. Ahead of them, the volcanic glow pulsed against the twilight sky.

And somewhere in Drusniel's chest, beside the debt that waited and the hollow where his magic slowly rebuilt, something new had taken root.

*Not alone,* he thought. *Not anymore.*

It felt strange. Uncertain. A little bit terrifying.

It felt like the beginning of something.
