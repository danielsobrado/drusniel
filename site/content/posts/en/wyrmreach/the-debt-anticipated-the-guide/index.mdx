## Chapter 23 | Part 1

--- 

Talryn never asked where they were going. She already knew.

That was the first thing Drusniel noticed about the guide, and the thing that bothered him most. She led them out of Nyxara's flower territory without consulting a map, without asking their destination, without even confirming the route with Varesh before departure. She walked east with the certainty of someone following written orders, which meant the orders had already been written before Drusniel agreed to anything.

Nyxara didn't react to choices. She anticipated them.

The second thing he noticed was the silence. Talryn spoke when spoken to, answered questions with the minimum number of words required to qualify as an answer, and volunteered nothing. She was not unfriendly. She was worse than unfriendly. She was professional.

"How far to the border?" Drusniel asked on the first morning.

"Four days. Standard pace."

"And after the border?"

"My assignment ends at the border."

"What's beyond it?"

"Outside my assignment."

Srietz tried on the first afternoon. The goblin had a gift for pulling conversation from reluctant sources, a lifetime of trading and dealing that had sharpened his tongue into a tool for opening closed doors. He walked beside Talryn and asked about the flowers, about the soil, about the chemical processes that Nyxara used in her cultivation.

Talryn answered each question with precision. The flowers were genus Tenebris, propagated from root cuttings. The soil was volcanic loam enriched with decomposed crystal substrate. The cultivation process was classified.

"Srietz admires the operation," the goblin offered, adjusting his pack. "Very sophisticated. Very profitable. Srietz wonders how long Lady Nyxara has been developing the strain."

"Before my time."

"And how long has Talryn served?"

"Long enough."

Srietz caught Drusniel's eye and shrugged. The goblin's sharp grin was absent. In its place was the flat expression he wore when calculations came back negative.

By the second day, the flower fields thinned. The cultivated rows gave way to wild growth, then to bare volcanic soil crossed with fissures that steamed in the perpetual twilight. Talryn adjusted their route without comment, steering them along ridgelines where the ground was stable, marking safe paths with the confidence of someone who had walked every inch of this territory and could draw it from memory.

The group dynamic changed. It happened gradually, in ways that Drusniel might not have noticed if he weren't already watching for it. Conversations shortened. Srietz stopped muttering his ongoing inventory of observations. Elion, who usually ranged ahead and behind in a loose patrol pattern, stayed close to the group. Even Drusniel found himself weighing words before speaking, editing thoughts before they reached his tongue.

They couldn't strategize. Couldn't plan. Couldn't discuss what they'd learned in Nyxara's territory or what waited beyond it. Every word spoken within Talryn's hearing would reach Nyxara. Not a suspicion but a fact, stated plainly in the terms of service. The guide observed and reported. Everything.

Drusniel tried to find private moments. He fell back on the trail, letting distance open between himself and Talryn. Within thirty seconds, the guide adjusted her pace to match. He stopped to examine a fissure, crouching at its edge. Talryn stopped too, fifteen feet away, watching the approach path with one eye and Drusniel with the other. He volunteered for the first watch on the second night. Talryn took the second, directly after, and she was awake and positioned before he could use the gap.

She was not hostile. She was thorough. The distinction mattered because hostility could be confronted, argued with, resisted. Thoroughness was just a wall.

At camp on the second night, Elion sat close enough that their shoulders almost touched.

"She sleeps light," Elion murmured. The shapeshifter had spent the day watching Talryn with the careful attention he usually reserved for predators. "Four hours. Never deeper than a doze. Weapon within reach. And she marks our positions before she closes her eyes."

"She's a soldier."

"She's an instrument." Elion's voice was flat. Concrete. "Nyxara's eyes and ears. We could be in a sealed room and she'd still be measuring us."

Drusniel watched the fire. Small flames. Talryn had built it efficiently, a contained heat source that gave light without announcing their position to anything beyond fifty feet. Even the fire was controlled.

"We wait," Drusniel said. "Four days. We walk, we comply, we give her nothing to report beyond routine travel."

"That's the problem." Elion shifted. "Routine is a report. How we walk. How we sleep. How we talk to each other. What we don't say. She's mapping us."

He was right. Drusniel felt it too, the slow accumulation of data points. The way Talryn's eyes tracked the group's social geometry, noting who deferred to whom, who spoke first, who carried the decisions. Every interaction was evidence. Every silence was a data point.

His gaze found a crack in the basalt near his boot. A thin line running from the fire pit toward the darkness, branching twice. He traced it with his eyes, letting the geometry occupy the part of his mind that wanted to spiral. The line split at a mineral deposit, pale quartz in black stone, and continued in two directions.

Every path forked. Every fork had a watcher.

On the third morning, Srietz pulled him aside during a supply stop. The goblin had been unusually quiet, which in Srietz's case meant the calculations had gotten serious.

"Srietz has been thinking about the cost," the goblin said. "Not the travel. Not the supplies. The cost of being watched."

"Nyxara said she values information."

"Yes. And information about us is worth more than protection costs. Think about what she's learning. Group structure. Decision patterns. Drusniel's magic. Elion's capabilities. Srietz's chemical knowledge." The goblin's ears twitched. "She's pricing us. Individually and as a set. When the guide's report reaches Nyxara, she'll know exactly what we're worth."

"We knew the terms."

"Srietz knew the terms. Srietz is questioning whether we understood the implications." He glanced at Talryn, who stood at the edge of the clearing, scanning the terrain ahead. "Safe passage is real. Nyxara keeps her agreements. But safe passage with full intelligence is not safe passage. It is a transaction where the product is us."

Drusniel didn't answer. He watched Talryn instead. The way she stood, weight balanced, eyes moving in a systematic pattern that covered every approach vector. A soldier's posture. An officer's awareness. And underneath that, the patience of someone who had been doing this for years and would continue doing it for years more, regardless of who she guided or what they thought of her.

He caught himself editing a thought. Not a spoken thought but a private one, an internal observation about Talryn's positioning that he reshuffled before it fully formed, as if the guide could read the inside of his skull.

She couldn't. He knew that.

But the reflex was there now. The self-censorship. The constant awareness of being observed. And that, he realized, was the real cost. Not the information Nyxara would receive. The information they would stop generating. The plans they wouldn't make. The conversations they wouldn't have. The strategies they wouldn't develop during four days of travel when strategy was what they needed most.

Nyxara's protection was a leash. Comfortable, well-made, and precisely the right length.

That night, Drusniel woke at the boundary between second watch and third. The fire had burned down to coals. Srietz slept in his tight, efficient curl. Elion sat motionless against a boulder, eyes open, watching the dark.

And Talryn stood over Drusniel's sleeping spot. Not crouching. Not reaching. Just standing, six feet away, looking down at him with an expression that held nothing at all.

She'd been watching him sleep.

Drusniel held still. Kept his breathing even. Watched her through slitted eyes. Talryn stood for another ten seconds, then turned and walked to the perimeter without a sound.

He didn't sleep again. In the morning, when they packed and moved, he said nothing about it. But the back of his neck prickled for hours, and every time he glanced over his shoulder, Talryn was exactly where she always was.

Watching. Measuring. Reporting.

They had two more days of this. Two more days of walking through safe territory that felt less safe with every mile, not because of what lay outside the path but because of what walked it beside them.
