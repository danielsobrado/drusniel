## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Static shot. Talryn stands motionless over the sleeping figure. Only her eyes move — a slow, deliberate scan downward across his body, cataloguing. The dying campfire embers pulse faintly.
[00:03-00:06] Her weight shifts imperceptibly. One hand opens and closes at her side. Steam drifts across the background from a volcanic fissure, catching the ember glow. Ash particles drift.
[00:06-00:08] She lifts her gaze to the dark perimeter. Her jaw sets. She turns and walks away, boots soundless on volcanic rock, swallowed by darkness.

Locked-off camera, low angle from ground level. Slight handheld shake.
Audio: deep volcanic rumble, faint crackling embers, wind through stone. Breathing — hers, controlled and steady. His, restless. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
