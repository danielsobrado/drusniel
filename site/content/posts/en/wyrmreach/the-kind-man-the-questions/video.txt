## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Wagon wheels grind deeper into the sand and then slow, grit spraying from the ruts as harness leather creaks and a covered canvas flap snaps in the wind.
[00:03-00:05] The caravan shifts position, one wagon angling to block the open stretch of coast; shadows move between the wheels as footsteps multiply.
[00:05-00:08] From inside the shelter, a figure steps across the mouth and briefly dims the light; the embers flare once, then settle as the line of wagons finishes forming.

Slow push-in from the shelter mouth toward the arriving wagons.
Audio: wheels scraping sand, harness creak, canvas snapping, bootsteps on grit, distant low volcanic rumble, ember crackle, rising wind. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
