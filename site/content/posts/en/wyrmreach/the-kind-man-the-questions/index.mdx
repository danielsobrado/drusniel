# Chapter 11.3 | The Questions

The days blurred together under Wyrmreach's unchanging sky.

Drusniel recovered slowly—too slowly for his liking, but his body refused to cooperate with his impatience. His magic remained muted, a hollow space that should have been full. The artifact against his chest had gone cold and silent since his arrival, neither helpful nor obstructive. Just... present.

Merrik was attentive. That was the word that kept surfacing in Drusniel's analytical mind. *Attentive*. The man brought food at regular intervals, adjusted the shelter against the strange winds, asked questions about comfort and recovery. He was, by every external measure, an excellent host.

But the questions never stopped.

"Where did you train?" Merrik asked on the fourth day, stirring a pot of the same strange broth. "Your magic. Air and water, you said—dual affinities are rare."

Drusniel paused before answering. He had said that. During the fever-dreams of his early recovery, when his guard was down and his words slipped out uncontrolled. He hadn't remembered saying it until Merrik repeated it back.

"A teacher in Umbra'kor," he said carefully. "Before I left."

"Must have been skilled. Dual-affinity training requires specific techniques." Merrik's tone was casual, conversational. "Not many masters can teach both elements together."

*Thirty-four questions now*, Drusniel counted. *Eighteen about my abilities. Eight about my destination. Five about my past. Three about the artifact.*

The artifact questions had come on the third day, subtle probes wrapped in helpful observations. *That metal on your chest—is it comfortable? I could fashion a better holder if you'd like. What does it do, exactly?*

Drusniel had deflected each one, giving answers that were technically true but revealed nothing. The artifact was a tool. It helped him navigate. Its exact function was... complicated.

Merrik had accepted each deflection with the same easy smile, never pressing, never demanding. Just asking. Always asking.

"You should be strong enough to travel soon," Merrik said that evening. "Another day or two, perhaps. I've been asking around—there's a caravan heading east in a few days. Safe route, experienced guides. We could join them."

"Asking around?"

"I have contacts. People who pass through, share information." Merrik shrugged. "The coasts aren't as empty as they look. Networks exist, if you know where to find them."

Networks. Contacts. People who shared information about survivors from the crossing.

Drusniel thought about hunters and slavers and the price that drow apparently commanded in Wyrmreach's strange economy. He thought about the questions—thirty-four and counting—and the delays, and the careful way Merrik had gathered information without ever seeming to gather information.

And he thought about the feeling that had been building in his chest since the second day. Not the debt—that was different, deeper, a weight that didn't diminish. This was something else. Suspicion, perhaps. Or the slow recognition of a pattern he didn't want to see.

"The caravan," he said. "When did you learn about it?"

"This morning. A messenger came through—they pass along the coast every few days. The caravan will be here in three days, maybe four."

Three days. Maybe four. More delay. More questions. More time for networks to activate and information to travel.

Drusniel looked at Merrik—really looked, for the first time since his rescue. The man's face was weathered but not unkind. His eyes assessed without threatening. His hands were those of a worker, calloused and capable.

He looked like exactly what he claimed to be: a coastal scavenger who helped survivors and knew useful things about dangerous territory.

But Drusniel's mind kept running numbers. Thirty-four questions. Five delays. One convenient caravan arriving just when he was strong enough to travel.

*Kindness and calculation aren't opposites*, something whispered in the back of his mind. *A farmer is kind to livestock.*

"I think I'd like to leave before the caravan arrives," Drusniel said. "Tomorrow, perhaps."

Something flickered in Merrik's expression. Too fast to read, quickly smoothed away. "That's... ambitious. You're recovering well, but another few days—"

"I've rested enough."

Merrik studied him for a long moment. The easy smile returned, but it felt different now. Thinner.

"Of course," he said. "If you feel ready. I can pack supplies tonight. We'll leave at first light."

Too easy. Too agreeable. Merrik, who had suggested delay four times, suddenly offering no resistance at all.

Drusniel lay awake that night, staring at the canvas shelter and listening to Merrik move around the camp. Packing, supposedly. Preparing for their early departure.

But the sounds seemed wrong. Too many footsteps. Too much movement for one man packing a simple journey.

When sleep finally came, it was fitful and restless. And in his dreams, he saw patterns—questions stacking into towers, delays forming walls, and at the center of it all, a kind man with a smile that never quite reached his eyes.

He woke to the sound of wheels in the sand.

The caravan had arrived early.
