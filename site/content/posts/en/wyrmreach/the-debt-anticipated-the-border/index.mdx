## Chapter 23 | Part 5

---

The border was not a line. It was a feeling.

The black crystal formations thinned over the last mile, their density dropping from forest to grove to scattered sentinels standing alone in volcanic soil. Beyond them, the terrain opened into a flat expanse of gray basalt scarred with shallow fissures and carpeted with pale lichen that crunched under their boots. The air changed. Nyxara's territory carried a specific humidity, a warmth laced with organic chemicals from the flower fields and crystal refineries. Here, the air was dry and tasted of nothing. The absence was louder than any smell.

Talryn stopped where the last crystal formation jutted from the ground, a pillar of black mineral as tall as Drusniel and half as wide, its surface catching light that shouldn't have existed in the perpetual dusk. She set her pack down.

"This is the boundary."

Four days of travel, four days of surveillance, and the guide was leaving them at a rock. Drusniel felt he should have expected something more ceremonial. He didn't know why.

"Srietz would like to clarify the status of Lady Nyxara's displeasure regarding certain conversations," Srietz said. His voice was measured, but his ears kept twitching toward the open ground ahead, already calculating the next leg of the journey.

Talryn looked at him for a long time. Whatever anger she'd shown in the pass had been filed away, stored behind the professional mask. But the mask fit differently now. Tighter.

"Lady Nyxara is not displeased with the goblin. Lady Nyxara is displeased with herself for misjudging the timeline." A pause. "She wished me to convey that she respects accurate knowledge, even when it is shared inconveniently."

Srietz processed that. "Srietz finds the distinction thin."

"It is."

Talryn reached into her belt pouch and produced a sealed container, small, no larger than a medicine vial, made of the same black crystal as the formations around them. She held it out to Drusniel.

"Lady Nyxara sends a parting gift. Three refined stabilizers, high concentration. For use in deep territory where the environmental effects exceed standard tolerance. She advises sparingly."

Drusniel took the container. It was warm, though whether from Talryn's body heat or from the crystal's own properties he couldn't tell.

"She also sends a message." Talryn's posture shifted. Not softer. Straighter, as if she were reciting prepared text. "Wyrmreach kills those who fight it. The crystals don't make you stronger. They make you less wrong. Use them sparingly. Each use teaches your body that this place is normal. Once your body learns that, it stops asking whether it should be."

The words settled over the group like a cold draft. Drusniel turned them over, feeling for the trap. Use the crystals. Let them normalize Wyrmreach's effects on the body. But normalization meant adaptation, and adaptation meant the body would stop resisting, stop treating the hostile environment as hostile. Stop asking the question that kept you alert: *should I be here?*

Once you stopped asking, Wyrmreach owned you. Not through force. Through comfort.

"And one more thing." Talryn's voice dropped. She looked directly at Drusniel, and for the first time in four days, her eyes held something personal. Not warmth. Recognition. The look of someone acknowledging a condition they'd seen before.

"Lady Nyxara says: the thing in your head wants your body. The old ones always do."

Cold spread through Drusniel's chest. Not the cold of Wyrmreach, not environmental, not physical. The cold of being known. Of having a secret stripped bare by someone who had never been in the room when it mattered.

Nyxara knew about the Voice. Not from Talryn's report. Not from the half-conversation she might have overheard between him and Elion. Nyxara had known before. The terms, the observation, the guide who watched him sleep. All of it had been calibrated around knowledge she'd already possessed.

"How long has she known?" The question came out before he could stop it.

Talryn shook her head. "Before you arrived. The specifics are above my clearance."

"And the old ones?"

"Above my clearance."

She lifted her pack and shouldered it with the efficiency of someone who had done this motion ten thousand times. The professional mask was complete again, seamless, a surface that reflected nothing.

"The approved route continues northeast for six miles, then enters Szoravel's border region. There are no checkpoints. No safe passage agreements. No guides." She adjusted her straps. "Lady Nyxara's protection ends here."

She turned and walked back into the crystal field.

Drusniel watched her go. She moved between the black formations with the ease of someone walking through a garden she'd planted herself, her silhouette shrinking against the faint glow of the crystals until the terrain swallowed her and there was nothing left to watch.

Srietz exhaled. The sound carried a week's worth of restrained commentary.

"Srietz has several observations," the goblin began.

"Later." Drusniel was still looking at the crystal field. The formations stood like sentries, dark and patient, marking the boundary of a territory that had never been safe. Only managed.

*The thing in your head wants your body. The old ones always do.*

Nyxara was wrong. He couldn't say how he knew, but the certainty was there, lodged between his ribs like a splinter. The Voice didn't want his body. It had never shown interest in possession, in control of his limbs or his speech or his physical self. What it wanted was harder to define and, because of that, harder to protect.

It wanted his choices. Every debt, every term, every carefully worded offer was aimed at the same target. Not his hands but his will. Not his body but the moment of decision, the instant when options narrowed to one and he reached for help he hadn't earned.

Nyxara's warning was a gift wrapped around a wrong answer. And wrong answers from knowledgeable sources were more dangerous than no answers at all, because wrong answers stopped you looking.

"Northeast," Elion said. The shapeshifter was already facing the open ground, reading the terrain with senses Drusniel couldn't share. "Six miles of nothing before we hit Szoravel's reach. We should move while there's still cover."

There was no cover. The flat basalt ahead offered nothing but distance and lichen and the occasional fissure leaking thin steam. But Elion was right. Stillness was more dangerous than motion, and they had debts piling up behind them, knowledge they hadn't paid for, protection they'd already been billed for, and a parting message that would sit in Drusniel's mind like a bone in his throat for days.

He slid the crystal vial into his pack beside the others. Three more stabilizers. Three more uses. Three more lessons for his body that Wyrmreach was home.

Srietz fell into step beside him. Elion took the forward position that Talryn had occupied for four days. The gap where the guide had been felt wider than one person should leave.

They walked northeast into territory that belonged to no one and promised nothing. Behind them, the black crystals caught the last of the dim light, a row of dark teeth marking the edge of everything Nyxara controlled.

Ahead of them, Szoravel waited. And between the debts already owed and the debts still forming, Drusniel carried the weight of a wrong answer that he couldn't correct without revealing what the right one was.
