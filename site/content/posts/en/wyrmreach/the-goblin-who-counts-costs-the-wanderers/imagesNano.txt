1. filename: lost-in-shifting-forest.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Elion]. Drusniel: measured focus; lips barely moving as he counts steps, posture steady despite fatigue. Elion: controlled tension; jaw tight, gaze scanning the treeline. They walk through a warped Wyrmreach forest where every direction repeats: black volcanic grit over vesicular basalt, tangled roots like wire, twisted stone formations like broken teeth, plants shifting in rhythms that ignore the wind; half-seen skull carvings and deliberate crystal markers appear on bark and rock as they pass, presence of watchers implied by subtle movement just beyond focus. Dim overcast daylight filtered through a thin canopy and ash-haze gives cold grey fill; highlights catch on wet bark ridges and on gritty basalt grains, while crystal facets show internal refraction that throws tiny cold glints onto nearby moss; shadows on stones skew slightly wrong, as if the sky light is inconsistent from step to step. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in drifting grit. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: drusniel-counts-steps.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel had counted their steps for three days now.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Cold calculation under strain; lips barely moving with each counted step, eyes flicking down and forward, cloak dusted with black grit. Close portrait while walking; the background collapses into repeating trunks and basalt spurs that blur into near-identical silhouettes, making distance feel meaningless. Cold grey sky light seeps through canopy and scatters across damp bark, creating soft specular points on wet leaf edges; a paler break in the canopy gives a thin rim that outlines cheek and jaw, while the shadow side stays cool and low contrast with subtle bounce from dark basalt below. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: territory-marks-skull-and-crystals.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The markers had started appearing two days ago.")
prompt:Macro detail of a fresh skull-shaped carving cut into wet tree bark: torn fibrous wood strands, sap beading at the edges, and a deliberate cluster of crystalline growths wedged into a basalt crevice as if placed by hand. Volcanic grit and damp black moss cling to roots; a faint oily shimmer hangs near the surface, visible only where it distorts the background like heat haze. Diffuse overcast daylight from above turns the scene cold and flat; wet sap holds sharp specular highlights, crystals show internal refraction and micro-facets that sparkle as tiny points, and the dark basalt absorbs most light while returning a faint cool bounce into the underside of the carving. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: elion-says-we-are-watched.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "He'd been saying variations of that for hours.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Alarmed restraint; eyes widened and fixed on the treeline, fingers curling then forcing stillness mid-step. He pauses as the warped forest repeats behind him into crooked trunks and stone spires fading into grey haze; undergrowth shifts without a clear cause, as if tracking the party. Cold overcast daylight provides flat grey fill from above; a thin break in the canopy drops a paler patch across one side of his face and shoulder, while dark basalt below returns a weak cool bounce that lifts shadow detail without warming it, making the stillness feel tense and staged. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: screech-in-the-treeline.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Then he heard it.")
prompt:Photorealistic wide shot at the treeline as a thin predatory shriek cuts the hush; Drusniel and Elion half-turn toward a gap between trunks where something small and fast hides behind bark, seen only as a blur and a brief glint where an eye should be. Twisted stone formations and root nets frame the opening; nearby plants tremble in a rhythm that does not match the air, and black volcanic grit looks freshly disturbed. Dim overcast daylight filtered through canopy gives cold fill; hard micro-highlights catch on disturbed grit and on wet leaf edges, while shadows around the gap skew subtly wrong as if a second unseen source deeper in the trees is adding a faint cold edge light that doesn't belong. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur on the darting shape, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
