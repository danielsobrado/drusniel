## Chapter 15 | Part 1

--- 

They were lost.

Not the kind of lost where you could find your way if you tried hard enough. The kind of lost where every direction looked the same, where landmarks shifted when you weren't watching, where the land itself seemed hostile to navigation.

Drusniel had counted their steps for three days now. *Four thousand, two hundred and twelve since the last recognizable feature.* The numbers brought no comfort.

"Something's watching us," Elion said.

He'd been saying variations of that for hours. His senses—whatever they were, however they worked—had been on edge since they'd entered this particular stretch of territory. The grey skin had gone almost white, and his movements had become tighter, more controlled.

"I know." Drusniel kept walking. There was nothing else to do. "Can you tell what?"

"No. It moves when we move. Stops when we stop. It's not attacking, just... observing."

The markers had started appearing two days ago. Skull shapes carved into tree bark. Crystalline formations that seemed too deliberate to be natural. The magical residue on the air had changed—heavier, darker, carrying intent that Drusniel couldn't read.

They'd stumbled into someone's territory. Someone who wanted visitors to know they were being watched.

*Territory markers,* Drusniel cataloged automatically. *Seven in the last mile. Increasing density suggests we're moving deeper into claimed land, not out of it.*

His magic whispered at the edge of his consciousness, slowly rebuilding. Not enough to fight. Maybe enough to defend, briefly. But something in his gut warned against using it here.

"The air tastes wrong," Elion said. "Worse than usual. There's something in these woods that doesn't want us here."

Drusniel could feel it too. The wrongness that permeated all of Wyrmreach was concentrated here, distilled into something sharper. The twisted stone formations cast shadows in directions that didn't match the dim light. The plants moved in rhythms that had nothing to do with wind.

Then he heard it.

A shriek at the edge of hearing. High and thin and predatory.

Elion's head snapped toward the sound. "That's what's been watching. And it just called for others."

"What is it?"

"I don't know." Elion's voice was flat, honest. "But there's more than one now. And they're getting closer."

Something moved in the treeline. Small. Fast. Watching.

And Drusniel realized, with cold clarity, that they had walked into something much worse than being lost.
