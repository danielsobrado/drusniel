## Chapter 3.2 | The Assessment

---

Zaelar's fingers closed around Drusniel's wrist. Cool, dry, stronger than they looked.

"Close your eyes," Zaelar said. "Breathe slowly. Try not to reach for anything—just let me observe."

Drusniel closed his eyes. His heartbeat pounded in his ears. Forty-one. Forty-two. He tried to slow his breathing, tried to empty his mind, but the questions kept circling. What was Zaelar doing? What would he find? What if there was nothing to find—what if the void had swallowed everything that made Drusniel special?

"Interesting."

Drusniel's eyes snapped open. "What? What do you see?"

Zaelar didn't answer immediately. His gaze had gone distant, unfocused, as if he were looking at something invisible. One hand still gripped Drusniel's wrist; the other traced patterns in the air.

"Hold still."

"Tell me what you're—"

"*Hold still.*"

Drusniel forced himself to wait. The candles flickered. Somewhere in the tower, an hourglass ran out—he heard the soft hiss of sand settling. Zaelar's fingers pressed slightly harder against his pulse point.

Then, slowly, the surface mage smiled.

"Extraordinary," he murmured. "Truly extraordinary."

"What? What is it?"

Zaelar released his wrist and sat back. His eyes had sharpened again, fully present, and something like genuine enthusiasm flickered across his gaunt features.

"Tell me, Drusniel—when you practiced with Annariel in your grove, what did you feel? Not the empathy game. The other practice. When you reached for Venemora's blessing."

"I felt..." Drusniel searched for words. "Pressure. Like something was almost there, just beyond reach. We could never quite touch it."

"And during the trial? Before the void?"

"The same. Except closer. Much closer. It was almost—" His throat tightened. "It was almost mine. And then it vanished."

"Of course it did." Zaelar stood and crossed to one of the shelves. He selected an hourglass—small, filled with pale blue sand—and held it up to the candlelight. "Venemora's blessing is divine magic. A specific frequency, if you will. A particular... shape."

"I don't understand."

"You have a gift, Drusniel." Zaelar turned back to face him. "A rare one. Perhaps the rarest I've encountered in two hundred years of study. You have elemental affinity. Air and water, both. Strong in each."

Air and water. The words hung in the dim room like smoke.

"That's impossible," Drusniel said. "Drow don't—"

"Drow don't practice elemental magic. That doesn't mean they can't possess the potential for it." Zaelar set the hourglass down with deliberate care. "Your people worship Venemora. You seek her blessing, her shadow-touched power. But that blessing is like... a lock. And your magic is the wrong shape of key."

Drusniel's hands had gone cold. "The trial. You're saying the trial failed because—"

"The trial didn't fail." Zaelar returned to his chair and leaned forward, his violet eyes intent. "The trial worked exactly as designed. It reached for your potential, and your potential reached back—but they couldn't connect. Venemora's blessing doesn't recognize your kind of magic. It's not designed for elemental affinities this pure."

The void. The horrible emptiness where power should have been. Drusniel had carried that sensation for days, convinced it meant he was broken. Inadequate. Less than.

But if Zaelar was telling the truth...

"So the trial... I didn't fail?"

"You're not broken, Drusniel." Zaelar's voice softened. Almost gentle. "You're rare. The trial was designed for lesser gifts. Your power doesn't fit their narrow blessing."

The words landed like rain on parched ground. Drusniel wanted to believe them—wanted it so badly his chest ached. But the explanation was too neat. Too perfectly shaped to fill the hole he'd been carrying.

*This sounds exactly like what I needed to hear. Exactly.*

The suspicion flickered and faded. Because even if Zaelar was manipulating him, even if this was somehow a trick—the alternative was the void. The emptiness. The certainty that he was broken.

He chose to believe.

Something loosened in his chest—a knot he hadn't known he was carrying. He wasn't broken. He wasn't inadequate. The void wasn't a sign of failure; it was a mismatch. Wrong key, wrong lock.

"Air and water," he repeated slowly. "What does that mean? What can I actually do?"

Zaelar's thin smile returned. "Let me show you."

He stood and moved to the center of the room, positioning himself beneath a wrought-iron vent in the ceiling. Drusniel noticed it for the first time—a grate allowing air circulation from somewhere above. A faint draft moved through it, barely perceptible.

"Watch carefully." Zaelar raised one hand toward the vent. "Feel the current above us. Cool air descending from the tower's upper levels. It wants to move—it's already moving. All we do is... suggest a direction."

His fingers curved slightly. The draft shifted.

Drusniel felt it on his face—a whisper of cool air that hadn't been there a moment ago, redirected from the vent toward where he sat. The candles on the nearest table flickered. One of them guttered out.

"You did that," Drusniel breathed.

"I *asked* that." Zaelar lowered his hand. "Air cannot be created from nothing. But existing air can be guided, shaped, redirected. Within arm's reach, the precision is absolute. At greater distances, you must work with what's already moving."

Drusniel stood without meaning to. His body had decided before his mind caught up. "Can I—"

"Not yet." Zaelar held up a hand. "First, you need to understand what you're working with. Sit."

Drusniel sat. His leg bounced against the chair. His thumb tapped rapid patterns against his fingers.

Zaelar watched him with something that might have been amusement. "Patience. You've spent your entire life reaching for a blessing that was never meant for you. Learning to work with your actual gifts will take time."

"How much time?"

"That depends on you." Zaelar moved to the shelves and retrieved a single candle, setting it on the table between them. The flame burned steady and straight. "Your anger, your frustration, your desperation—they scatter the air. Emotional disruption makes precision impossible. Before I can teach you to move anything, you must learn to be still."

Stillness. Drusniel had never been good at stillness. His mind raced constantly, counting, cataloging, searching for patterns. Even now, his heartbeat drummed in his ears: seventy-three, seventy-four...

"I can try," he said.

"Try isn't good enough." Zaelar settled back into his chair. "This magic has costs. Push too hard, and your body will pay the price. Breathlessness. Headaches. Worse, if you're reckless. The surface mages who mastered elemental work learned discipline first. Speed, power, range—those came later."

Drusniel stared at the candle flame. Steady. Unwavering.

He wanted to be good at this. Wanted it with a ferocity that surprised him. His whole life, he'd been reaching for something that pushed him away. Now, for the first time, someone was telling him his power was real—just different. Not broken. Rare.

"When can we start?" he asked.

Zaelar smiled. The expression didn't quite reach his eyes.

"We already have."
