1. filename: assessing-affinity.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: focused intensity, gaze gone distant; one hand closed around Drusniel's wrist at the pulse point, the other tracing small patterns in the air. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Tense and trying to hold still, breathing shallow.
Environment: Candlelit tower room with hourglasses on shelves and old texts in unreadable scripts behind them, tea table between, steam and dust hanging in the warm air. Candlelight is warm and low, carving deep shadows across knuckles and glass; reflections ripple along hourglass curves while faint gray daylight adds a thin cool rim at the room edges.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: finding-the-key.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Wrong key, wrong lock.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Calm certainty, explaining with a small controlled smile. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Wary, hungry focus, eyes fixed on the object as he listens.
Environment: Close two-shot at the table as a small hourglass filled with pale blue sand is held up to the candle. Warm candlelight glints along the glass curve and throws amber reflections across fingertips; cold gray window spill adds a thin cool rim to the glass edge while background books dissolve into blur.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: air-current-demo.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "His fingers curved slightly.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Controlled precision, fingers curved slightly as he redirects the draft. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Startled attention, feeling the air on his face.
Environment: Demonstration beneath a wrought-iron ceiling vent: a cool current visibly shifts through candle smoke and dust motes, bending the nearest flames and lifting a loose page edge on the table. Warm highlights skate across the iron grate; smoke ribbons catch light and then vanish into deep shadow.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: bending-candle.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The candle on the nearest table flickered.")
prompt: Tight tabletop close-up as a redirected draft bends a candle flame hard to one side and then snuffs it out, wax drips and soot marks visible on the lip while neighboring flames flicker violently.
Environment: The candle itself is the primary light, warm orange glow reflecting off melted wax and ceramic glaze; the moving air is visible in shifting smoke and flame shape as shadows jump across the table grain and the snuffed wick breathes out a thick dark plume.
Camera: Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: still-candle-lesson.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel stared at the candle flame.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: fierce concentration forced into stillness, jaw unclenching by effort; fingers tapping once and then stopping as he stares at the steady flame.
Environment: Single candle placed on the table between them, hourglasses and unreadable books blurred behind in soft shadow. Warm candlelight carves cheekbones and catches tiny highlights in the eyes; the surrounding room falls off into near-black with a faint cool rim from distant daylight.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
