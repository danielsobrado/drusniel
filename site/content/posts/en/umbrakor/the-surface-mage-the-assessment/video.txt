## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The candle flame bows sharply sideways as if grabbed by an unseen hand. Wax trembles at the rim and the light flickers across the tabletop in fast, jittering shadows.
[00:03-00:05] The flame collapses and dies in a single snap. A thick ribbon of dark smoke pours upward, twisting as the redirected draft continues to push it sideways.
[00:05-00:08] The smoke thins and breaks into wisps that coil toward the vent overhead. Nearby candles flare and then settle back to a steady burn, leaving the snuffed wick glowing dull orange for a beat before fading.

Slow pan from the snuffed wick to the remaining candle flames.
Audio: sudden rush of air, candle flutter, soft pop as the flame dies, smoke hiss, wax drip, faint hourglass sand hiss in the background. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
