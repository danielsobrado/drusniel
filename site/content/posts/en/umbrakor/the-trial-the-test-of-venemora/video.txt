## Veo 3 Prompt

[0-3s] Drusniel kneels on the black stone platform, eyes closed, hands flat on the warm obsidian. His fingers press harder. The purple bioluminescent light from the fungi overhead flickers once. A faint heat-shimmer appears above his hands, then collapses. His breathing quickens.

[3-6s] He reaches one hand forward into the air above the altar. The purple light bends toward his fingertips and dies. A sphere of absolute blackness blooms where the light was, expanding slowly. His fingers lose their color at the edges. The shimmer is gone. Only absence remains, growing.

[6-8s] Drusniel's hand drops. He opens his eyes. The void vanishes instantly, leaving only the ordinary purple chamber light. He stares at his empty palm. Behind him, out of focus, a mage checks something off a slate without looking up.

Slow crane down from overhead to eye-level as the void expands, settling into a static frame when his hand drops.
Audio: deep stone resonance, a low thrumming that cuts to silence when the void appears, the scratch of a stylus on slate, Drusniel's ragged exhale. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
