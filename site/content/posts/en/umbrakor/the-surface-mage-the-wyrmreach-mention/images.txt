1. filename: wyrmreach-book.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Neutral and deliberate, choosing his words; holding an ancient book open to a marked page and pointing to a hand-drawn coastal sketch and barrier markings in unreadable script. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Wary attention, eyes fixed on what he cannot read. Interior of Zaelar's tower entry hall, gray surface daylight cutting long shadows across stone while hourglasses on nearby shelves glitter with reflections behind them. Warm interior candlelight mixes with cold daylight spill from the open door, catching paper fibers, glass curvature, and drifting dust. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: horror-of-sea.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "'Wyrmreach is a death sentence.'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Tight jaw, skeptical eyes; delivering the words flatly. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Controlled calm, listening without flinching. Tense two-shot in the tower hall with shelves of hourglasses and old books behind them, the open doorway bleeding gray surface light into the room. Cold daylight from outside flattens the stone into muted grays while warm candlelight adds amber edge highlights to faces and glass; dust shifts in a faint draft between them. Canon EOS R5, 50mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dual-affinity-reveal.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "'Air magic is the only reliable way.'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Absorbing the implication, breath held steady; thumb tapping once and then stopping as he thinks. Close portrait as Zaelar speaks just out of focus, tea steam curling in the air beside Drusniel's face while a small bowl of water on a side table shows a faint ripple from the redirected draft. Warm candlelight catches the steam as soft ribbons and throws amber highlights across the water surface; cold gray daylight adds a cool rim along the bowl edge and the bridge of his nose. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: fragile-family.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "'Your family's position may be more fragile.'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Going perfectly still, shock tightening into anger. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Thin controlled smile, unhurried as he sips cold tea. Charged moment in the tower: hourglasses glint behind them and the long gray daylight shadows stretch across the stone floor, making the hall feel suddenly measured and hostile. Warm candlelight catches tiny specular points on glass while cold daylight drains color from faces, leaving a clinical tension in the contrast. Sony A7R IV, 35mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: leaving-tower.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel stood on the tower's threshold")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Squinting into the gray, urgency rising; one foot already angled toward the hills home. Wide exterior at the tower threshold as Drusniel looks out over rolling hills and layered clouds leading back toward the distant slope that hides the tunnel entrance. The wind tugs at his cloak and carries wet cold air; clouds break just enough to send pale shafts of sun through, brightening patches of grass while the rest remains muted gray. Canon EOS R5, 24mm f/1.4, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
