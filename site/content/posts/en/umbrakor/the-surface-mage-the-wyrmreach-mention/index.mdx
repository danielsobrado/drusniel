## Chapter 3.4 | The Wyrmreach Mention

---

Drusniel didn't make it to the door.

"Before you go." Zaelar's voice stopped him at the threshold. "There's something I've been considering. Something I haven't mentioned."

Drusniel turned. The gray light from outside cast long shadows across the entry hall. The hourglasses on their shelves caught the light and glittered.

"What?"

Zaelar moved to one of the larger shelves and ran his fingers along the spines of ancient books. "Your affinity—air and water both—it's exceptionally rare. Among drow, perhaps unique. But there are places in the world where such gifts are... valued."

"Valued how?"

"Recognized. Cultivated. Given room to grow without the restrictions your people impose." Zaelar selected a book and opened it to a marked page. Drusniel couldn't read the script. "There's a land called Wyrmreach. Those with elemental affinity are prized there. Protected, even."

Wyrmreach.

The name landed like a stone in still water. Drusniel had heard it before—whispered in the deep places of Umbra'kor, mentioned in the kind of stories parents told children to keep them from wandering too far. A forbidden realm. A place where drow didn't return from.

"Wyrmreach is a death sentence," he said flatly. "The barrier, the crossing—no one survives it."

"No one from your world survives it." Zaelar closed the book. "Most who attempt the crossing lack the gifts necessary. But you have air affinity, Drusniel. Air magic is the only reliable way to cross the nightmare seas. The creatures there hunt by vibration, by pressure change. Someone who can manipulate the air around them... someone who can sense approaching threats through shifts in current..."

"You're saying I could survive it."

"I'm saying very few could. And you might be one of them."

Drusniel's thumb tapped against his fingers. One, two, three, four. The counting helped him think. Helped him process what Zaelar was actually suggesting.

Leave. Cross into a forbidden realm. Abandon everything he knew.

"Why would I do that?" The question came out sharper than he intended. "I don't want to go to Wyrmreach. I want answers about what happened to me. I want to know who blocked my trial and why."

"Of course." Zaelar set the book aside. His expression was neutral, patient. "I wasn't suggesting you leave now. Only that options exist. That your gifts might open doors you haven't considered."

"I'm not considering them."

"Fair enough." Zaelar moved toward a small side table and poured himself a cup of the cold tea that remained from earlier. "But you should know—the situation in Umbra'kor is not stable. Your family's position may be more fragile than it appears."

The words hit harder than they should have. Drusniel went still.

"What do you mean?"

"The political tensions you've felt—the rival house your father warned you about—they're escalating." Zaelar sipped his tea. Unhurried. "I have sources who keep me informed of developments below the surface. What's coming may be worse than your family expects."

"You know about the rival house?"

"I know about many things." Zaelar set down his cup. "I'm not trying to frighten you, Drusniel. I'm simply noting that Wyrmreach might become relevant sooner than you think. If circumstances in Umbra'kor deteriorate... if you find yourself needing to disappear..."

He let the sentence hang.

Drusniel's jaw tightened. "I'm not running away."

"No one said you would be." Zaelar's smile was thin. It didn't reach his eyes. "Just something to consider. Your training here will take time—weeks, at minimum. A great deal can change in weeks."

The hourglasses on the shelves seemed louder suddenly. Sand falling through glass. Measuring time that couldn't be recovered.

"I should go," Drusniel said again.

"Yes. You should." Zaelar walked him to the door. The gray light outside had shifted, the clouds breaking enough to let pale shafts of sun through. Not dangerous yet—but a reminder that the surface had its own rules. "Return tomorrow at dawn. We'll continue with air work, and I'll begin assessing your water affinity as well."

Water. Drusniel had almost forgotten that part of the assessment. Air *and* water, Zaelar had said. Both strong.

"Why both?" he asked. "Why would one person have two affinities?"

"An excellent question." Zaelar's expression flickered—something that might have been genuine interest beneath the careful control. "Dual affinity is rare. It suggests your potential was shaped by unusual circumstances—or shaped *for* unusual circumstances. The old texts speak of such individuals in relation to specific places, specific purposes."

"What kind of purposes?"

"That's a discussion for another time." Zaelar opened the door. The surface air rushed in, carrying its strange scents. "Go home, Drusniel. Rest. Let your body recover from today's work. And consider what I've said—not as a command, but as information. Knowledge is rarely harmful."

Drusniel stepped through the doorway. The gray light stung his eyes, but less than before. He was adjusting.

"Tomorrow," he said.

"Tomorrow."

The door closed behind him.

Drusniel stood on the tower's threshold and looked out at the surface world. Hills folded into each other, gray and strange, leading back toward the tunnel entrance that would take him home. The clouds had shifted enough to let more light through—he needed to move soon, before the exposure became dangerous.

But something Zaelar had said kept circling in his mind.

*Your family's position may be more fragile than it appears.*

His father had said something similar. *Something is coming. Stay close to home.* Political tension. The rival house. Dangers that had nothing to do with failed trials or stolen blessings.

And now Zaelar was suggesting that Drusniel's gifts might let him escape—if escape became necessary.

*Wyrmreach.*

He pushed the thought away. It was too big, too strange, too much to process alongside everything else. He had air magic. Real power, finally, after years of reaching for something that refused to reach back. That was enough for now. That was more than enough.

But as he walked toward the distant hillside, Zaelar's words followed him like a shadow:

*A great deal can change in weeks.*
