1. filename: obsidian-antechamber.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Architecture]. Carved obsidian antechamber beneath Umbra'kor, pale bioluminescent fungi clustered on the vaulted ceiling, a dozen young drow candidates in thin ceremonial robes sitting in groups along the walls, whispering and praying. Cavernous space of polished volcanic glass, fungi colonies overhead casting uneven pools of cyan bioluminescence downward, light refracting off the vitreous obsidian floor in cold blue-green caustics, deep shadow pooling between the carved pillars. Sony A7R V, 16mm f/2.8 GM, Cinestill 800T. Vesicular basalt walls with microcrystalline obsidian veining, fungi exhibiting subsurface scattering through translucent fruiting bodies. Aspect ratio 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: counting-nervous-habit.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Your thumb... tapping.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Tense jaw, gaze downward. Thumb frozen mid-press against index finger, knuckles taut against thin linen robe. Obsidian alcove behind the hand, a single fungal cluster on the wall casting cold blue-green bioluminescence that rims each finger with cyan edge light, the glow bouncing off the vitreous obsidian surface and filling the creases of his dark knuckles with reflected color. Sony A7R V, 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM, Kodak Portra 400. Keratinized nail beds with visible lunulae, linen weave at 200-thread count catching individual photons from the bioluminescent source. Aspect ratio 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: annariel-whisper.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "We have each other.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Annariel]. Earnest half-smile, forced confidence in the eyes. Leaning close to Drusniel, mouth near his ear, whispering. Low obsidian ceiling with a dense fungal cluster directly above them, bioluminescence falling from upper-left and painting blue-green across Annariel's cheekbone and the bridge of his nose, light scattering through his white hair strands, Drusniel's far side dropping into umbral shadow. Sony A7R V, 85mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400. Dermal translucency at the ear cartilage where the fungal light passes through, individual hair strands acting as fiber-optic conductors for the cyan glow. Aspect ratio 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: priest-arrival.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A priest emerged from the inner chamber")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Priest]. Impassive authority, hollow cheeks. Standing in the inner chamber doorway, dark robes trailing, candidates below looking up from seated positions. Doorway framing a deeper violet glow from the ritual chamber beyond, the priest silhouetted with light bleeding around his robes and casting a long violet-tinged shadow forward across the obsidian floor, the antechamber fungi providing dim competing cyan fill from the walls. Sony A7R V, 35mm f/2.8 GM, Cinestill 800T. Woven spider-silk vestment fibers catching violet backlight with anisotropic reflectance, obsidian floor exhibiting conchoidal fracture patterns reflecting the dual light sources. Aspect ratio 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: entering-darkness.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel stepped into the darkness.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Shoulders drawn tight, head slightly bowed. Walking alone through a carved obsidian threshold into absolute blackness, the antechamber glow fading on his back and robe hem. Last fungal bioluminescence catching the edge of his ceremonial robe and the tips of his white hair from behind, light fall-off following inverse-square law into the pure dark corridor ahead, faint cyan caustics rippling across the threshold stone. Sony A7R V, 50mm f/1.8 GM, Cinestill 800T. Linen robe fibers exhibiting forward scattering at the backlit hem edge, obsidian threshold worn smooth with a satin micro-finish from centuries of foot traffic. Aspect ratio 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
