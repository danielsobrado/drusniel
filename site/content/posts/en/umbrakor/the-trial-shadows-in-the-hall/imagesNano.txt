1. filename: father-at-gate.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Father]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Arms crossed, stance wide, jaw clenched. Dark silhouette standing at a compound gate. The bioluminescent glow of the family estate washing pale blue-green behind him, his posture reads as a wall. Estate bioluminescence backlighting him from behind, blue-green photons outlining his shoulders and crossed arms with a cold rim light, his face remaining in near-total shadow with only reflected ambient light catching the ridge of his brow, the gate's iron surface producing faint specular reflections of the estate glow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Gate: wrought iron, oxidized surface with forge-scale texture, low reflectivity except at polished contact points. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: mother-cold-reception.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "'It's done. You're home.'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Mother]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Face perfectly composed, eyes careful, no visible emotion. One cool hand raised touching the side of a young drow's face. Looking through him rather than at him. Stone entry hall with an old doorframe behind her showing a familiar crack in the wood. Interior bioluminescent fixtures casting even cool clinical illumination across her features, the light reflecting off the polished stone floor and bouncing upward under her chin, her hand on his face catching a secondary reflected glow from below, no warm-spectrum light anywhere in the scene. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores. Stone floor: polished limestone, moderate albedo, diffuse reflection pattern. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: shyntara-suspicion.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "'Where have you been sneaking off to?'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Shyntara]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Leaning against a stone wall, one hand on the pommel of a dagger at her hip. Eyes locked forward with predatory focus, humorless half-smile. Stepped closer, an arm's length away. Compound corridor with obsidian walls and mounted blades in background. A wall-mounted torch to her left casting sharp directional warm-spectrum light across one side of her face, the other side falling into hard shadow, the polished dagger pommel producing a bright specular highlight, torch flame flickering and creating micro-variations in the shadow edge along her cheekbone. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background. Dagger pommel: polished steel with leather-wrapped grip, high specular reflectivity at the rounded surface. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: father-study.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Knives of every design hung from pegs")
prompt: Interior of a narrow study lined with weapons. Curved, straight, serrated, smooth blades hanging from iron pegs on every wall. A scarred wooden desk at center, a drow patriarch standing behind it with both hands flat on the surface. Claustrophobic, every surface occupied. Firelight from a low hearth at the far wall casting flickering warm photons that strike dozens of blade edges simultaneously, each polished edge acting as a linear mirror producing a constellation of bright specular points across the walls, the scarred desk surface diffusely reflecting warm light upward onto the patriarch's hands and jaw, iron pegs absorbing most light while blade steel redirects it. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Blade steel: high-carbon steel with honed edge, mirror-polish bevel producing directional specular reflection. Desk surface: scarred hardwood, years of knife-testing gouges creating micro-facets that scatter reflected light. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: drusniel-tracing-walls.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He traced the blade-marks on the study walls.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Face distant, unfocused eyes, lost in thought. One hand raised, fingertips tracing a deep gouge in the stone wall. The scratch old and familiar. Blades on pegs visible in soft background. Firelight from the hearth casting warm directional light from below and right, photons catching the ridges of the wall gouge in sharp relief, the carved groove creating a shadow channel while the raised edges reflect light, Drusniel's fingertips illuminated where they touch the stone while his face falls into partial shadow. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Macro Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores. Wall gouge: stress fracture in quarried stone, rough conchoidal interior surface with smooth worn edges from years of contact. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
