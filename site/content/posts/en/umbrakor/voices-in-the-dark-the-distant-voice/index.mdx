## 2.2 | The Distant Voice

---

The presence strengthened. Solidified. Like a thread being pulled taut between them.

*Drusniel? Can you hear me?*

He sat up in bed, heart pounding so hard he could feel it in his throat. The voice wasn't sound—it was impression, meaning pressed directly into his mind. The way their connection had always worked, back in the grove. Pattern recognition. Intimacy. Something they'd never been able to name.

*Annariel?* He shaped the thought as clearly as he could. *How—I thought they isolated you.*

A pause. The presence flickered, as if gathering strength.

*They did.* The voice came through clearer now. *No outside contact. Complete isolation. But I had to understand what happened in there. The way your trial ended—it didn't make sense from where I was standing.*

Drusniel's eyes burned. He pressed the heels of his hands against them, forcing back the tears that wanted to come.

*You found a way.*

*I found a way.* A pause. *It's not easy. The distance makes this difficult to maintain. But tell me what happened. Walk me through it.*

The request was direct. Focused. Drusniel noticed the shift—less comfort, more information-gathering—but pushed the observation aside. Annariel had always been practical under pressure.

*I'm not hurt,* he sent carefully. *If that's what you mean.*

*But the trial. What exactly did you feel when it failed?*

Drusniel closed his eyes. *I felt the blessing approaching. The warmth, the thinning resistance—everything we practiced. And then... nothing. No response. Like the connection was there and then it simply wasn't.*

*That's not how normal failure works.* The presence pulsed with what felt like certainty. *I've been listening in the training halls. When candidates fail naturally, they never feel the warmth at all. They reach and find nothing from the start. What you're describing is different.*

The words hit like a fist to the chest. Validation. After days of isolation, of doubt, of his family's careful avoidance—someone was analyzing this with him. Someone saw the anomaly.

*I thought I imagined it,* he sent. *My sister said it was threshold echo. That my mind created the sensation because I wanted it so badly.*

*That's one explanation.* The voice was measured. *But it doesn't match what I observed. I saw your face during the trial. You weren't hoping—you were connecting. Then something changed.* A pause, then: *Remember that night in the grove? When we first felt the connection? You said you'd never give up. You said—*

The memory was wrong. It had been Annariel who said that, not Drusniel.

Drusniel's stomach tightened. *That's not how I remember it.*

A brief hesitation. *Isn't it? The isolation is confusing things. The details blur.*

Maybe. Drusniel let it pass. But he filed the mismatch away.

*What do I do?* he asked. *Everyone thinks I just failed. My father says the assassin path was always my calling. They want me to forget it happened and move on.*

*You can't move on without understanding.* The voice carried a different edge now—analytical, solution-oriented. *If something unusual happened—and the pattern suggests it might have—don't you want to know how? Why?*

*Of course I do.* Drusniel's jaw clenched. *But how? The mages won't help me—they think I'm just another failure. My family doesn't believe anything unusual happened. And you're...*

*Isolated. I know.* A pause. The presence seemed to gather itself, like someone choosing words carefully. *But I've been listening. Learning things. The training halls have more information than people realize—mages talk, and they don't always notice who's listening.*

*What kind of information?*

Another pause. Longer this time.

*There's someone on the surface,* the voice said finally. *A mage who trains people outside Venemora's system. They say he's controversial—dangerous, even. Some of the instructors speak of him with real fear. Others with grudging respect.*

Drusniel's heart stuttered. The surface. Where drow didn't go. Where sunlight killed.

*You want me to go to the surface?*

*I want you to consider it. He might understand what happened to you—he studies magic in ways the temple mages don't. How it can be blocked. Interrupted.* A pause. *But I won't pretend it's safe. He might be wrong about everything. He might be dangerous for reasons beyond his reputation. I don't know enough to be certain.*

Zaelar. The name hadn't been spoken yet, but Drusniel felt it forming.

*What's his name?*

*Zaelar.* The presence carried something like reluctance. *The mages here speak of him in whispers—some with fear, some with respect. He might know what happened to you. He might also be exactly as dangerous as they say.*

Zaelar. The name landed in Drusniel's mind like a stone dropped into still water.

*I've heard that name,* he sent slowly. *Rumors. Bad ones.*

*Rumors spread by people who fear what they don't understand.* The voice softened. *But that doesn't mean the fears are wrong. I'm not saying trust him blindly. I'm saying he might know how something like this could be done. The method. The technique. Whether that's worth the risk—that's your decision.*

The framing helped. Not a solution. A possibility. A dangerous one.

But what was the alternative? Stay in his room? Practice reaching until his mind broke? Accept that he'd failed and spend the rest of his life as his father's assassin—never knowing what had happened, or why?

*I'll think about it,* he sent.

*That's all I'm suggesting.* The presence began to fade, the connection thinning like a thread stretched too far. *I should go. The isolation makes this exhausting. But I'll reach you again. I promise.*

*Annariel—*

*I meant what I said.* The voice was barely a whisper now, a brush of warmth at the edge of his awareness. *In the trial chamber. I'll find you. However long it takes.*

Then the presence was gone.

Drusniel sat in darkness, alone with his thoughts. The questions still had no answers. And his head pounded from the connection—a dull pain behind his eyes that wouldn't fade.

The surface. He'd never been above ground. The stories said sunlight could kill a drow in minutes. That the air itself was wrong, too thin, too bright.

And he was supposed to find a mage there? A controversial figure even the trained mages feared?

*Zaelar.*

He whispered the name aloud, testing its weight on his tongue.

It was dangerous. Possibly fatal. His family would be furious if they found out. And the voice—Annariel's voice—had felt almost right, but not quite. That wrong memory. That slight delay in rhythm.

But what was the alternative? 

Drusniel lay back against his pillows. His mind raced, but his body demanded rest. The connection had taken more than he'd realized.

*I'll think about it,* he'd said.

He wasn't sure yet. Not completely. But he was closer than he wanted to admit.
