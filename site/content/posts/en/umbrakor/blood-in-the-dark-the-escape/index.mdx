## Chapter 6 | Part 3
--- 

The corridor twisted ahead, branching into servant passages and storage rooms. Drusniel ran without thinking, guided by instinct and the half-remembered maps his father had made him memorize years ago.

*Emergency exits. Rally points. The passages no one uses. The routes that might save your life when everything else fails.*

His father's voice, patient and precise, drilling information into a son who hadn't wanted to listen.

*Pay attention. This matters.*

It mattered now. Too late for his father to know it mattered.

Behind him, footsteps. Multiple. Coordinated. The measured pursuit of professionals who'd been doing this longer than Drusniel had been alive.

"This way. He went left. Check the storage rooms."

Drusniel ducked into a side passage. Pressed himself against the wall. His heart hammered in his chest, loud enough that they had to hear it, had to know exactly where he was—

*Calm. Precision requires calm.*

Zaelar's voice in his head. The training that had seemed abstract just hours ago.

He forced himself to breathe. Slow. Controlled. The way Zaelar had taught him before each exercise.

*Feel the air. Let it tell you what's happening.*

The footsteps grew closer. Drusniel's new sense—the one Zaelar had helped him develop over months of patient practice—registered movement in the air currents. Two figures approaching from the main corridor. One more circling to cut off the far exit.

Three attackers. One of him. No weapon. Magic that had barely begun to develop.

But there was air. There was always air. His father's compound had a sophisticated ventilation system—Drusniel's grandfather had installed it, drawing fresh air from the deeper caverns. Drafts flowed through channels in the walls, emerging through grates at regular intervals.

There. A strong current, pulling through the grate behind him. Cold air from the deep tunnels.

*Don't command. Suggest.*

The lead attacker rounded the corner. Saw him. Raised his blade. This close, Drusniel could see scars on the man's exposed forearm. Old scars. A professional who'd been fighting longer than Drusniel had been alive.

"Nowhere to run, boy."

Drusniel gathered the draft. Compressed it the way he'd learned—not with force, but with focus. His grief screamed at him to lash out, to scatter the air in chaotic rage the way he had in the main hall. But that hadn't worked. That had been emotion, not skill.

*Precision requires calm.*

His mother's face flashed through his mind. Empty eyes. Blood spreading.

He pushed the image away. Not now. Not yet.

He released.

The air-push caught the attacker center-mass. Not enough to injure—it would never be enough to truly hurt, not at this stage of his training—but enough to stagger. The man stumbled backward, arms pinwheeling, colliding with the second attacker who'd been right behind him.

Drusniel ran.

His lungs burned. His head throbbed. The magic had cost him more than it should have—emotional turmoil disrupting the efficiency Zaelar had drilled into him. He gasped for breath, vision swimming at the edges. Blood trickled from his nose, warm against his upper lip.

*Can't do that again. Not yet. Body needs time to recover.*

The third attacker appeared ahead of him, blocking the passage. The one who'd circled around. Faster than Drusniel had expected.

No draft here. No current to redirect. The ventilation channels didn't reach this section. Drusniel's magic was spent, his body emptied, his options narrowing to nothing.

He dropped low. Instinct—assassin's training that had never quite taken but had left its marks anyway. The attacker's blade whistled over his head, close enough to feel the wind of its passage.

Drusniel rolled. Came up running. Felt the man's fingers catch his sleeve and tear free.

The exit was ahead. A servant's door, hidden in the wall, leading to the outer tunnels. He'd found it years ago while exploring. Had wondered why anyone would need a secret door in a storage corridor.

Now he knew.

Drusniel hit it at full speed. The ancient mechanism gave way—rust and dust and decades of neglect surrendering to desperate momentum. He tumbled through into darkness.

Behind him, shouting. "He's in the tunnels! Move! Don't let him—"

But the tunnels were a maze. Generations of drow had carved them, expanded them, connected them to other tunnel systems. Even the attackers—professional, coordinated, deadly—would have trouble following.

Drusniel ran until his legs gave out. Then he crawled. Then he dragged himself into a crevice barely large enough to hold him and pressed his back against cold stone.

His nose was bleeding freely now. He hadn't noticed until the blood dripped onto his hands. The copper taste filled his mouth, mixing with smoke and tears he hadn't realized he was crying.

He was alive.

*If I hadn't stayed so long at the tower—*

The thought surfaced and he killed it. Not now.

His parents were dead.

And somewhere in the darkness behind him, their killers were still hunting.
