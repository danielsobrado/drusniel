# Chapter 3.3 | The First Lesson

---

The candle burned. Drusniel stared at it until his eyes watered.

"Stop glaring," Zaelar said from across the room. "You're not trying to intimidate the flame. You're trying to feel the air around it."

"I'm trying."

"You're straining. There's a difference."

Drusniel forced his shoulders to relax. His jaw unclenched. The candle sat on the table in front of him, its flame dancing gently in the ambient draft from the ceiling vent. An hour had passed since Zaelar's demonstration. An hour of breathing exercises, of sitting still, of trying to sense something that refused to be sensed.

He was beginning to think this was a mistake.

"Close your eyes," Zaelar said.

"That didn't work the last three times."

"Close them anyway."

Drusniel closed his eyes. Darkness. The smell of wax and old paper. The faint whisper of air moving through the roomâ€”from the vent, he reminded himself. Always from somewhere. Air had to come from somewhere.

"Now. Stop trying to *find* the current." Zaelar's voice had shifted, softer now, almost hypnotic. "You already know where it is. You felt it on your face earlier. The air is moving whether you sense it or not. You're not discovering something hiddenâ€”you're paying attention to something obvious."

Obvious. The draft from the vent was obvious. Drusniel had felt it since he entered the room, a subtle coolness against his skin. He'd ignored it the way he ignored most background sensationsâ€”unremarkable, irrelevant.

But now he paid attention.

The air moved. From above, through the grate, down into the room. It spread as it descended, cooling as it went. Some of it reached the candle flame, making it dance. Some of it brushed past Drusniel's face and continued on toward the door.

He could feel it. Not clearlyâ€”more like sensing the shape of something in the dark by the way it displaced the space around it. But it was there. Real. Moving.

"Good," Zaelar murmured. "Now. Reach toward the current. Not with your handâ€”with your intention. Feel where the air is going, and... suggest a different direction."

Drusniel reached.

Not physically. Something else. Some part of him that had been reaching his whole life without knowing what it was reaching *for*. He felt the draft from the vent, felt its natural path downwardâ€”

And pushed.

The candle flame bent. Just slightly. Just for a moment. A lean to the left that the ambient air couldn't explain.

Drusniel's eyes flew open. "I felt it."

"You did more than feel it." Zaelar nodded toward the candle. "You moved it. Barelyâ€”but you moved it."

The flame had steadied again, dancing in its normal rhythm. But Drusniel had seen it. Had *felt* it. For one instant, the air had listened to him.

"Again," he said. "I want to do it again."

"Slowly. Feel the current first. Don'tâ€”"

But Drusniel was already reaching. The success had lit something in his chest, a fierce bright hunger that demanded more. He found the draft from the vent, grabbed at it with that strange internal sense, and *shoved*.

The air scattered.

Three hourglasses toppled from the nearest shelf. The candle flame guttered wildly, throwing shadows across the walls. Papers flew from a stack on Zaelar's desk. Something glass shattered against the floor.

Drusniel's chest heaved. His head throbbed. He hadn't moved, but his body felt like he'd sprinted up a flight of stairs.

"That," Zaelar said calmly, "is what happens when you command instead of suggest."

"I didn't meanâ€”"

"Your anger scattered the air." Zaelar knelt and began collecting the fallen hourglasses. His movements were unhurried, almost deliberate. "Precision requires calm. The current responds to intention, yesâ€”but chaotic intention produces chaotic results."

Drusniel pressed a hand to his temple. The headache was sharp, localized, like someone had driven a nail behind his right eye. "I was excited, not angry."

"To the air, there's no difference." Zaelar set the hourglasses back on the shelf, checking each one for damage. "Strong emotion is strong emotion. It bleeds into your intention whether you mean it to or not. The old texts called air magic 'breath of intention' for a reason. Your breath is calm when you're calm. When you're not..."

"The air goes everywhere."

"Precisely."

Drusniel stared at his hands. They were trembling slightly. The success had felt so goodâ€”so *right*â€”that he'd wanted more immediately. And in wanting too much, he'd lost what little control he had.

"Can I try again?"

Zaelar regarded him for a long moment. Then, slowly, he nodded.

"Once more. And this time, remember: you are not commanding the air to move. You are asking it. Politely. With respect for what it already wants to do." He righted the candle, which had somehow survived the chaos. "Feel the current from the vent. Follow its natural path. And *suggest* a gentle redirection toward the flame. Nothing more."

Drusniel closed his eyes. Breathed. Let the desperation settle into something quieter.

The draft was still there. Still descending from the vent, spreading as it fell. He found the edge of itâ€”the part that naturally curved toward the candleâ€”and reached for it with something softer than before. Not a grab. A touch. A whispered request.

*This way. Just a little.*

The flame bent. Held. Bent further.

Drusniel opened his eyes. The candle was leaning hard to the left, its flame stretched nearly horizontal, pointing directly at Zaelar across the room.

"Better," Zaelar said. "Now let it go."

Drusniel released his grip on the current. The flame snapped upright, resumed its normal dance. His breath came faster than it should have, and the headache still pulsed behind his eye, but the exhaustion was less severe this time. More manageable.

"That's enough for today." Zaelar moved to the window and looked out at the gray sky. "Your body needs time to adjust to this kind of work. Push too hard too fast, and the costs escalate quickly."

"What costs?"

"Breathlessness proportional to effort. Headaches, as you've noticed. Nosebleeds if you overreach significantly. And worse, if you're truly reckless." He turned back to face Drusniel. "Magic has prices. Elemental magic is no different. The surface mages who forgot that lesson didn't survive to teach it."

Drusniel's headache throbbed in agreement. But beneath the pain, something else burned: the memory of the flame bending. Of the air *listening*.

His whole life, he'd reached for power that rejected him. And now, finally, something had reached back.

"I want to keep practicing," he said.

"Tomorrow." Zaelar's voice brooked no argument. "Your body needs rest. So does your mind. Come back at dawn, and we'll continue."

Dawn. The word triggered a cascade of realizations. How long had he been here? Hours, at least. His family would notice his absence. His father's warnings echoed: *Stay close to home. Something is coming.*

"I should go," Drusniel said.

"You should." Zaelar walked him toward the door. His robes whispered against the stone floor. "One more thing, before you leave."

Drusniel paused at the threshold.

"The power you felt todayâ€”it's real. Whatever else you question, know that." Zaelar's violet eyes held his gaze. "You spent years reaching for something that was never meant for you. Now you've touched what actually belongs to you. That's rare, Drusniel. That's worth protecting."

Worth protecting. The words settled into Drusniel's chest alongside the memory of bending flame.

"I'll be back at dawn," he said.

Zaelar smiled. The expression was thin, controlled.

"I know you will."
