1. filename: air-move-attempt.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Watery eyes, sweat at the brow; shoulders tense but trying to relax, jaw unclenching by effort. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]. Watching from across the room, patient and controlled.
Environment: Lamplit tower study interior with a single candle on the table and a wrought-iron vent overhead feeding a faint cool draft. Candlelight flickers warm orange across skin texture and hourglass glass; cold gray daylight from a window adds a thin cool rim along the table edge and stone wall, while dust motes hang in the mixed light.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: feeling-the-draft.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He felt the draft from the vent")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes closed, breathing slowed; hair and robe edge lifting slightly as he pays attention to the cool current, expression tightening and then easing.
Environment: Tight portrait with the candle flame blurred in the foreground and smoke pulled sideways by the vent draft. Warm candlelight shapes cheekbones and catches tiny highlights in eyelashes; the cool airflow makes the flame lean and sends a thin ribbon of smoke across the frame into deep shadow.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: chaos-burst.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The air scattered.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Startled shock, jaw tight; half-risen from the chair as the control breaks and the room erupts.
Environment: Sudden burst of redirected air scatters papers and topples hourglasses from a shelf; candle flame whips sideways and throws frantic shadows; glass shatters on stone. Warm candlelight strobes across flying paper edges while background objects smear into motion blur, keeping the face sharp in the chaos.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: nosebleed-cost.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel pressed a hand to his temple.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. One eye squeezed shut, breath shallow; pressing fingers to his temple as the headache spikes, hand trembling slightly.
Environment: Tight close-up with toppled hourglasses and broken glass blurred on the stone floor behind him. Warm candlelight catches sweat sheen and skin texture; faint cold gray daylight rim from the window makes the pain feel exposed and clinical.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: success-bend.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The flame bent. Held.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Fierce focus settling into control, breathing steadier; holding the suggestion without pushing. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]. Calm observation, letting it happen.
Environment: Wide view across the table as the candle flame bends nearly horizontal, stretched like a banner of fire pointing directly toward Zaelar. Warm candlelight mixes with cold gray daylight from the window, creating a clear warm-cool split; the flame throws sharp moving highlights across ceramic and glass while the room beyond stays dark.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
