1. filename: air-move-attempt.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Watery eyes, sweat at the brow; shoulders tense but trying to relax, jaw unclenching by effort. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]. Watching from across the room, patient and controlled. Lamplit tower study interior: Drusniel seated at a wooden table staring at a single candle while a faint cool draft from the ceiling grate makes the flame dance; hourglasses and old papers sit on shelves around them. Warm candlelight is the primary light, flickering orange across skin texture and glass, while cold gray daylight from a window adds a thin cool rim along the table edge and stone wall. Canon EOS R5, 50mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: feeling-the-draft.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He felt the draft from the vent")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes closed, breathing slowed; hair and robe edge lifting slightly as he pays attention to the cool current. Tight portrait with the candle flame blurred in the foreground and the wrought-iron vent above implied by the direction of the draft, the room around him held quiet. Warm candlelight shapes his cheekbones and catches tiny highlights in eyelashes; the cool draft makes the flame lean and sends a thin ribbon of smoke sideways. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: chaos-burst.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The air scattered.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Startled shock, jaw tight; half-risen from the chair as the control breaks. Sudden burst of redirected air in the study: papers lift and scatter, three hourglasses tumble off a shelf, candle flame whips sideways and throws frantic shadows, and glass shatters against the stone floor. Candlelight flickers violently, making highlights strobe across flying paper edges while the background drops into blur; motion blur on papers, faces kept sharp. Sony A7R IV, 35mm f/2.8, Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: nosebleed-cost.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel pressed a hand to his temple.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. One eye squeezed shut, breath shallow; pressing fingers to his temple as the headache spikes behind the eye. Tight close-up with toppled hourglasses and broken glass blurred on the floor behind him, his hand trembling slightly from the effort it cost. Warm candlelight catches sweat sheen and skin texture; a faint cold gray daylight rim from the window makes the pain feel clinical and exposed. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: success-bend.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The flame bent. Held.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Fierce focus settling into control, breathing steadier; holding the suggestion without pushing. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]. Calm observation, letting it happen. Wide shot across the table as the candle flame bends nearly horizontal, stretched like a banner of fire pointing directly toward Zaelar on the far side of the room, hourglasses and shelves framing the scene. Warm candlelight mixes with cold gray daylight from the window, creating a clear warm-cool split; the flame throws sharp moving highlights across ceramic and glass while the room beyond stays dark. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
