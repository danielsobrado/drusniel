# Chapter 5.2 | The False Friend

---

The presence found him that night.

Drusniel lay in darkness, unable to sleep, when the familiar warmth brushed against his awareness. The texture that felt almost like Annariel. Close enough.

*Drus. Are you alright? I sensed something... wrong.*

He reached toward the connection. *House Vrinn. My father says they're making moves against us.*

A pause. Then, carefully: *I've heard things.*

*What things?*

*Names. Fragments of dates, I thinkâ€”the reports were coded.* The presence pulsed with urgency. *I can't say moreâ€”the training halls have ears, and they might be monitoring mental connections. But something about your family has been circulating. I've seen indirect references. Vrinn-aligned mages discussing Thel'varin territory.*

Drusniel sat up in bed. His heart thudded against his ribs. *How do you know?*

*I passed the trials. I have access to places you don'tâ€”council archives, intelligence summaries. Things filter through.* A thread of fear wound through the connection. *I've seen... I think it was correspondence. Vrinn agents reporting on house movementsâ€”I couldn't tell whose family specifically, but the context suggested...* The presence hesitated, correcting itself. *Actually, I'm not certain it was your family. But the territories they mentionedâ€”it would fit.*

*They're spying on us.*

*More than spying. They're planning. I saw a reference to "the Thel'varin solution." I don't know what it means, but the context...* The presence darkened with worry. *Be careful, Drusniel. These people are dangerous. More dangerous than your family realizes.*

Drusniel's thumb tapped against his fingers. Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five.

*What else did you see?*

*Weapons requisitions. Troop movements. They've been hiring mercenariesâ€”surface-dwellers, outsiders who don't know drow customs.* A thread of disgust wound through the connection. *They're not even pretending this is political anymore. It's military.*

*My father thinks we have time.*

*You might not.* The presence pulsed with urgency. *Whatever they're planning, it could be soon. The reports I sawâ€”they're moving assets into position. I couldn't read the timeline clearly, but the urgency in the correspondence... a week? Maybe two? I'm not certain, Drus. I wish I knew more.*

The words unsettled Drusniel. A week, maybe two. The voice wasn't certainâ€”but even the uncertainty felt like a warning. Whatever his family thought they were preparing for, the reality might be worse.

*Why would they target us specifically? We're not the largest house. Not the most powerful.*

*You're in their way. Your territory blocks their expansion into the western districts. Your trade agreements compete with their merchant arm. And your father...* Hesitation. *Your father humiliated their house elder at the market council three years ago. Some grudges don't fade.*

It made sense. All of it made sense. The escalating tension, the mapped patrol routes, the assassins near the bordersâ€”it fit a pattern of calculated aggression.

*What should I do?*

*Stay alert. Stay close to your family.* The presence warmed with something that felt like protectiveness. *And train, Drus. Keep training with Zaelar. You might need that power sooner than you think.*

*I will.*

*I couldn't bear to lose you too.* The words carried weightâ€”grief and fear and something that might have been love. *You're the only real friend I have. The only person who understood me before all of this started. If Vrinn hurts you...*

The presence didn't finish the thought. Didn't need to.

*I'll be careful,* Drusniel sent. *I promise.*

*Good.* The warmth began to fade. *I'll keep listening. If I learn anything more, I'll tell you. But don't trust anyone outside your family right now. Not the servants. Not the guards. Not anyone who might have Vrinn connections.*

*I understand.*

The presence withdrew. Drusniel lay in darkness, staring at the ceiling.

House Vrinn. The enemy had always been faceless, namelessâ€”the rival house that threatened from a distance. Now it had shape. History. Motivation.

And according to "Annariel," it had been watching his family for weeks. Planning something. Building toward a "solution."

Drusniel's hands clenched beneath his blankets. The air in the room stirred, responding to his anger.

If they touched his familyâ€”if they made good on whatever they were planningâ€”

He would make them regret it.
