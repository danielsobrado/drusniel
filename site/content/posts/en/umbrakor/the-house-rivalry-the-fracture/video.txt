## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] In the darkness, Drusniel’s fingers clench under the blanket; the candle flame leans hard to one side and dust lifts off the stone floor.
[00:03-00:05] The dust snaps into a fast ring around the bedposts, tugging the blanket edge and making a tin cup on the nightstand chatter; the fungal glow flickers as if the air is being squeezed.
[00:05-00:08] He forces his grip to loosen and exhales; the ring breaks into drifting motes, the cup settles, and the flame straightens—silence returns, but the last specks keep circling for a heartbeat.

Slow dolly-in from the doorway to the bed.
Audio: candle crackle, cloth rustle, faint whoosh of moving air, metal cup rattle, distant water drip in the tunnels, one sharp inhale and a long exhale. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
