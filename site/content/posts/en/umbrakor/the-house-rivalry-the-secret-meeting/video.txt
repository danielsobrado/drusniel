## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Zaelar’s calm questioning continues as Drusniel shifts his stance, sweat dripping onto the desk edge; the nearest hourglass ticks louder in the silence.
[00:03-00:05] Zaelar leans forward and taps the map with one finger. An hourglass gets nudged and sand spills in a thin stream; Drusniel’s eyes snap to the falling grains like a warning.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel swallows, answers too carefully, then steps back a fraction. The lamplight flickers and the spilled sand keeps sliding across the desk as the room tightens around them.

Slow lateral slide across the desk from Zaelar to Drusniel.
Audio: hourglass tick, sand hiss, paper rustle, oil-lamp hiss, distant tower creak, controlled breathing, one quiet swallow. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
