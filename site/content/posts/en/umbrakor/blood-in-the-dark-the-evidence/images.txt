1. filename: finding-meren.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Shocked focus, eyes wide and wet, trying to hold the moment still long enough to understand it. Silent corridor near the wine cellar: Drusniel kneels beside old Meren slumped against a stone wall, blood pooling beneath the steward’s torn formal jacket; Meren’s hand grips Drusniel’s wrist with desperate strength as if forcing out a last message. A single lantern from the cellar doorway provides warm, low light that catches wet blood sheen and dust in the air; faint blue-green fungal stains along the stone add cold edge highlights on knuckles and wall texture. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: pristine-dagger.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The dagger was pristine. Perfect.")
prompt:Macro close-up of a dagger on cold stone near a limp hand: the blade and hilt look polished and pristine in a corridor otherwise marked by massacre—blood smears nearby, but the grip remains clean; a stamped emblem of three interlocking circles above a curved blade catches a sharp glint. Lantern/firelight provides warm specular highlights along the hilt ridges and insignia while the surrounding dust and dried droplets stay matte; background falls into smoky blur. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mental-doubt.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Why is there no blood on the hilt?")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Suspicion flickering through grief, brow tightening as the anomaly lands. Tight portrait of Drusniel holding the dagger in his palm and staring at the spotless hilt: dried blood crusts on his face from a nosebleed, his fingers smeared red, but the weapon remains unnaturally clean; corridor shadows and distant bodies blur behind. Warm lantern light hits the metal and his knuckles in amber, while the rest of his face falls into cool shadow with faint fungal rim highlights outlining his cheek and ear. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: rage-drowning-logic.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The grief slammed back, drowning the doubt like a wave erasing marks in sand.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Doubt crushed into cold rage, jaw set as he closes his fist around the dagger until his knuckles whiten. Emotional collapse in the aftermath corridor: smoke haze, blood traces on stone, and dead silence broken only by settling dust as he chooses a target to blame. A harsh torch/lantern beam from the side provides hard directional light that carves his features and throws a long shadow behind him; warm highlights catch on the dagger’s clean metal while the background fades into murk. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: taking-the-weapon.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He tucked the dagger into his belt and kept moving.")
prompt:Close waist-level shot of Drusniel sliding the pristine dagger into his belt with a decisive, controlled motion; his hands are still stained with dried and fresh blood, fabric and leather at his waist dusty from crawling through tunnels, corridor behind dark and empty except for faint signs of violence. Warm lantern light catches the dagger’s clean edge and the texture of worn leather; the rest falls into cold shadow with a faint blue-green rim on stone edges. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
