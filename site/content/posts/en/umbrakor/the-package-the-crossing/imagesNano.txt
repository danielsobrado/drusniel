1. filename: portal-ritual.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: wary focus at the edge of a decision, posture braced against the wrongness ahead. On a cliff edge, Drusniel faces the barrier: air thick like oil-smeared glass, colors shifting at the boundary and distant shapes beyond hinting at red light and black rock; Zaelar watches from a safe distance. The barrier provides an unnatural purple-green iridescent sheen that slides across drifting mist and damp stone; flat overcast daylight keeps the surrounding forest muted and cold, with specular points only on wet rock edges. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: drusniel-hesitating.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He stepped up to the line.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: one last measured breath, jaw tight, eyes fixed forward as fear becomes motion. Drusniel steps up to the line where the barrier begins, boots at the cliff edge as the air ahead warps like dirty glass smeared with oil; the world behind is normal forest and stone, the world ahead is a red-black suggestion that refuses to resolve. The boundary throws faint iridescent reflections onto cheek and collar; overcast daylight stays flat on rocks and windblown grass, keeping the background matte. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: zaelar-push.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Go.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: eyes hard and intent, mouth open mid-command, one hand lifted as if pushing a student forward. Medium shot of Zaelar calling over the wind from a safe distance, pale gaze locked on Drusniel at the boundary as the barrier shimmers behind like oil on glass. Overcast daylight provides cold neutral fill; the barrier adds a thin purple-green sheen along robe edge and raised knuckles, interactive highlights sliding as the surface ripples. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight lens flare from the boundary sheen. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: stepping-through.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel stepped forward.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: teeth clenched as resistance fights him, eyes burning, body forced forward one step at a time. Side profile as he walks into the barrier, half in the normal world and half swallowed by oily distortion; wind behind cuts off abruptly, leaving stillness around the boundary. The boundary splits light: cold grey daylight on the side he leaves, heavier red-tinged light and shadow on the side ahead, iridescent ripples crawling across his silhouette like liquid and reflecting on damp stone. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur at the barrier edge, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: void-experience.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The world dissolved.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: panic buried under function, eyes wide as gravity disappears. The ground drops away and Drusniel plunges into black water, bubbles tearing from his clothes as cold pressure crushes in; far below, an impossible shadow shifts and a huge faint glow hints at something turning. No external light penetrates except a weak grey smear above the surface; the water eats color and leaves only cold contrast, suspended particulate, and dim reflections on bubbles. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle motion blur in bubbles. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
