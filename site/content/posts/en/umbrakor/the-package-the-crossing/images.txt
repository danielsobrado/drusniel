1. filename: portal-ritual.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, wary focus at the edge of a decision; posture braced against the wrongness ahead. On a cliff edge after half a day of travel, Drusniel faces the barrier: air thick like oil-smeared glass, colors shifting at the boundary and distant shapes beyond hinting at red light and black rock; Zaelar watches from a safe distance, small but present. The barrier itself provides an unnatural sheen, purple-green iridescence sliding across drifting mist, while flat overcast daylight keeps the surrounding forest and ruins muted and cold. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drusniel-hesitating.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He stepped up to the line.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, one last measured breath; jaw tight, eyes fixed forward as fear is forced into motion. Drusniel steps up to the line where the barrier begins, boots at the cliff edge as the air ahead warps like dirty glass smeared with oil; the world behind him is normal forest and stone, the world ahead is a red-black suggestion that refuses to resolve. The boundary throws faint iridescent reflections onto his cheek and collar, while overcast daylight stays flat on the rocks and windblown grass behind. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: zaelar-push.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Go.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] drow with blueish ash skin color, Photorealistic, eyes hard and intent; mouth open mid-command, one hand lifted as if pushing a student and a weapon forward at once. Medium shot of Zaelar calling over the wind from a safe distance, pale gaze locked on Drusniel at the boundary as the barrier shimmers in the near background like oil on glass. Overcast daylight provides cold neutral fill, while the barrier adds a thin purple-green sheen along the edge of his robe and raised knuckles. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight lens flare from the boundary sheen. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: stepping-through.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel stepped forward.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, teeth clenched as resistance fights him; eyes burning, body forced forward one step at a time. Side profile as Drusniel walks into the barrier, his body half in the normal world and half swallowed by oily distortion; soundless air implied by the stillness of his hair and the abrupt cutoff of wind behind. The boundary splits light: cold grey daylight on the side he leaves, heavier red-tinged light and shadow on the side ahead, with iridescent ripples crawling across his silhouette like liquid. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur at the barrier edge, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: void-experience.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The world dissolved.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, panic buried under function; cheeks taut, eyes wide as gravity disappears. The world dissolves and the ground drops away: Drusniel plunges into black water, bubbles tearing from his clothes as cold pressure crushes in; far below, an impossible shadow shifts and a huge faint glow hints at something turning. No external light penetrates except a weak grey smear above the surface, while the water itself eats color and leaves only cold contrast and suspended particulate. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle motion blur in bubbles. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
