1. filename: bamboo-grove-spar.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Two drow figures circling each other with blades drawn in a subterranean grove of tall fungal stalks resembling pale bamboo, low mist curling around their ankles, the grove floor carpeted in damp spore-dust. Wide establishing shot through the fungal stalks, dim bioluminescence filtering down through the canopy of translucent caps overhead, throwing broken columns of blue-green light across the mist and glinting off drawn steel. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: shyntara-strike.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Shyntara flowed around his attacks")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Shyntara]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Cold focus, zero exertion on her face. White hair whipping mid-dodge, blade a steel blur at waist height, body twisted in fluid evasion. Action shot frozen mid-movement, a single shaft of bioluminescent light from above catching the arc of her blade and streaking across the mist she displaces, Drusniel visible behind her slightly off-balance and out of focus. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: blade-at-throat.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Cold metal kissed his throat.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Drusniel's eyes wide with shock, Shyntara's gaze flat and pitiless. Extreme close-up of Shyntara's blade pressed against Drusniel's throat, the steel edge indenting the skin, a bead of sweat rolling past his jawline. Tight two-shot at throat level, cold steel catching a thin line of reflected bioluminescent light along its edge, Shyntara's slender fingers in sharp focus on the hilt while the fungal grove behind falls to soft bokeh. Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: magic-failure.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "'Magic only flows through noble blood'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Frustration hardening into quiet desperation. Drusniel staring at his own open hands, fingers slightly curled, willing something that will not come, Shyntara a blurred figure in the background with arms crossed. Over-the-shoulder framing past Shyntara toward Drusniel's empty palms, the grove's dim bioluminescence casting blue-green across his palms and leaving the gaps between his fingers in deep shadow, no glow, no magic, just skin and stillness. Canon EOS R5, 50mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: shyntara-exit.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Shyntara melted back into the shadows")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Jaw set, alone, hand resting on sword hilt. Drusniel standing in the fungal grove watching Shyntara's figure dissolve into the dark gaps between the pale stalks, her white hair the last thing visible before the shadows take her. Wide shot from behind Drusniel at mid-distance, the grove's bioluminescent canopy overhead casting broken patches of light on the mist, Shyntara's retreating form half-absorbed by darkness between the fungal trunks. Sony A7R IV, 50mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
