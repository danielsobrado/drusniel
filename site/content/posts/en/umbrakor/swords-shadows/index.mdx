## Chapter 2

--- 

*The darkness of the passage pressed close, and his mind reached for something familiar—*

Drusniel slipped through the bamboo grove, each step placed the way his instructors had drilled into him since he could walk. His blade caught a sliver of light. Ahead, Shyntara's pale hair marked her against the dark like a challenge.

They circled each other. Feet quiet on the forest floor, watching for the first twitch of intent.

Blade met blade. The clash rang through the mist. Drusniel's arms shook as he pushed against her strength—she'd always been stronger, and knowing it didn't make it easier.

He shoved hard, spinning into a series of strikes. Shyntara slipped past every one. Dodged left, leaned right, her hair swinging as she moved. Always just out of reach. Always one step ahead.

His jaw tightened. He'd trained for this. He'd practiced until his hands bled. And she was still better, without even trying.

He pressed forward, searching for an opening. There – a gap in her defense. Drusniel lunged, certain of victory.

At the last instant, Shyntara twisted. Drusniel's blade sliced empty air. An elbow slammed into his sternum. He stumbled back, lungs emptying in a rush.

Cold metal pressed against his throat. Drusniel went still.

"Getting sloppy, little brother." Shyntara's lip curled. Not a hair out of place. Not even breathing hard.

Drusniel glared as she lowered her weapon. "If I could use my magic, I would've had you."

Shyntara's laugh was short and flat. She sheathed her blade. "Still clinging to that fantasy? Magic only flows through noble blood, and ours has grown thin."

Drusniel looked away. She wasn't wrong—not about the blood, anyway. In Umbra'kor, magic meant power. Everything else was just surviving.

"You're wasting your time up here," Shyntara continued, her voice softer now. "Come home, Drusniel. Accept your place. There's honor in serving as a Shadowblade."

Drusniel's fists clenched at his sides. "I won't go back to being nobody. I know I have power. Annariel sees it. He's helping me unlock it."

Shyntara's eyes narrowed. "That boy from House Vrinn? He's using you, brother. Whatever he's promised you, it's a lie. You know how our families feel about each other."

"You're wrong." Drusniel turned away. The bamboo trunks vanished into mist in every direction. "Annariel gets it. He knows what it's like to be overlooked."

"Change things?" Shyntara's voice hardened. "The only change in Umbra'kor comes through blood and betrayal. Your friendship with that boy will get you both killed."

"Maybe." Drusniel didn't turn around. "But I'd rather die trying than spend my life being nobody."

Silence. Then her hand on his shoulder, lighter than he expected.

"I hope you're right," she said quietly. "But if you're wrong — don't expect mercy. Not from the Council. Not from me."

She let go. When he turned, the bamboo grove was empty.

Drusniel stood alone in the mist. His hand rested on his sword hilt, but his mind was somewhere else entirely.
