1. filename: bamboo-grove-spar.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Two drow figures circling each other with drawn blades in a subterranean grove of tall pale fungal stalks, low mist curling at ankle height, spore-dust coating the ground. Cavernous grove with translucent fungal canopy overhead filtering dim bioluminescence into broken columns of blue-green light, the glow refracting through mist particulates and casting soft caustics across the damp ground, steel blades reflecting cyan pinpoints back into the haze. Sony A7R V, 35mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400. Chitin-reinforced fungal stalks with longitudinal fiber bundles visible at the base, mist composed of suspended spore particulates exhibiting Tyndall scattering in the bioluminescent light. Aspect ratio 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: shyntara-strike.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Shyntara flowed around his attacks")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Shyntara]. Cold focus, zero effort visible. White hair whipping mid-dodge, blade a steel blur at waist height, body twisted in fluid evasion, Drusniel off-balance behind her. Single shaft of bioluminescent light from above catching the blade arc, the displaced mist spiraling in the wake of her movement, light bouncing off the flat of the steel and throwing a brief cyan flash across her cheekbone. Sony A7R V, 35mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400. High-carbon steel blade showing differential hardening line along the edge, displaced mist revealing laminar-to-turbulent flow transition in the wake of the blade path. Aspect ratio 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: blade-at-throat.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Cold metal kissed his throat.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Drusniel's eyes wide, Shyntara's gaze flat. Blade edge pressed against Drusniel's throat, skin indented, a bead of sweat rolling past his jawline. Tight framing at throat level, the honed steel edge catching a hairline of reflected bioluminescent cyan along its bevel, light transmitting through the sweat bead and refracting a tiny spectrum onto the blade flat, Shyntara's fingers sharp on the grip while the fungal grove falls to deep bokeh. Sony A7R V, 85mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400. Polished steel exhibiting specular micro-reflections along the hand-ground bevel, perspiration droplet acting as a convex lens with visible meniscus tension at the skin contact point. Aspect ratio 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: magic-failure.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "'Magic only flows through noble blood'")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Frustration hardening into quiet desperation. Staring at his own open palms, fingers slightly curled, willing something that will not come, Shyntara blurred in the background with arms crossed. Dim bioluminescence from the canopy above casting blue-green across his open palms, light pooling in the cup of his hands and reflecting off the moisture on his lifelines, the gaps between his fingers falling into pure shadow, nothing glowing, nothing happening. Sony A7R V, 50mm f/1.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400. Palmar skin showing dermatoglyphic ridges and moisture-filled sulci reflecting the overhead bioluminescence, no arcane emanation, raw dermis under natural fungal light only. Aspect ratio 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: shyntara-exit.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Shyntara melted back into the shadows")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Jaw set, alone, hand on sword hilt. Standing in the fungal grove watching Shyntara's figure dissolve into darkness between the pale stalks, her white hair the last visible element. Bioluminescent canopy overhead casting broken patches of cyan on the mist, Shyntara's retreating form half-absorbed by the shadow between fungal trunks, the light falling off sharply past the nearest stalk row leaving the deeper grove in near-total darkness. Sony A7R V, 50mm f/1.8 GM, Cinestill 800T. Fungal stalk surfaces exhibiting hygroscopic moisture condensation with visible micro-droplets catching individual photons from the canopy, mist density increasing with depth following exponential extinction. Aspect ratio 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
