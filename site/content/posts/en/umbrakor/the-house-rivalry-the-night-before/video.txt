## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel leans on the balcony rail, trying to steady his breathing as the city-glow pulses below. Shyntara steps into the edge of the lantern light behind him.
[00:03-00:05] She closes the distance and lifts a finger toward his chest. Drusniel flinches, jaw tightening; his hand grips the stone harder as the haze shifts in a sudden draft.
[00:05-00:08] Shyntara holds the point a beat longer, then lowers her hand and turns away. Drusniel stays frozen, swallowing hard as the lantern flame flickers and the bioluminescent glow below feels colder.

Slow push-in from behind Shyntara to Drusniel at the railing.
Audio: distant city hum, faint tunnel drip, lantern flame hiss, cloth rustle, one footstep, stone grip scrape, controlled breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
