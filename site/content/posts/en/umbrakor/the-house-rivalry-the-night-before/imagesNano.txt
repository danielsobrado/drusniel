1. filename: family-dinner.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father, Mother, Shyntara, Drusniel]. Father rare laugh lines breaking through the tactical mask; Mother quiet pride and careful calm; Shyntara guarded posture with a brief softening; Drusniel awkward, genuine laughter returning. Family dinner in the compound dining room: steaming spiced mushroom stew, crisp-skinned cave fish, warm bread torn by hand, wine bottle near the centerpiece; bioluminescent flowers arranged on the table while reinforced door latches and a few weapons by the doorway hint at danger outside. Teal bioluminescent bloom-light rises from the centerpiece and pools under chins and hands; candle flames add amber flicker that catches ceramic glaze and glass reflections, with mixed-color shadows feathering across carved stone walls. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: father-laughing.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "His father laughed—actually laughed, a sound Drusniel heard maybe twice a year.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father]. Unguarded laughter, eyes creasing with warmth; bread in hand, shoulders loosening as steam drifts up from the stew between him and the lens. Teal flower-glow underlights his jaw and knuckles; amber candle flicker paints cheekbones and throws tiny specular glints on a cup rim, with the family falling into soft shadow behind. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, natural skin with pores, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: balcony-talk.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Shyntara found him on the balcony after dinner.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Drusniel wary, exhausted focus as he senses her approach; Shyntara neutral assessment hiding concern, stance balanced to move. Two-shot at the balcony railing over Umbra’kor’s bioluminescent lattice below, damp stone balustrade under their hands, faint condensation in their breath. Blue-green city-glow rises from below and rims profiles; a small wall lantern behind them adds a weak amber edge that grazes hair strands and shoulder seams, reflections sliding along wet stone as haze drifts. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in haze, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: accusation.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "You're lying.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara, Drusniel]. Shyntara professional cold focus, finger pointed like a verdict; Drusniel guarded fear and defiance, throat tight, eyes refusing to drop. Over-shoulder confrontation on the balcony with the railing dividing them and the city glow webbing the background. Blue-green underlight carves hard cheek edges; warm lantern spill lays a thin amber stripe across the pointing finger and Drusniel’s collar, mixed-color shadows stacking on stone and cloth folds. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: regret.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "I should have told her everything.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Regret settling in, eyes distant, mouth held thin; hands gripping the stone railing as the compound falls quiet behind him. Alone on the balcony with the city’s bioluminescent pulse below and a faint doorway glow behind. Cool blue-green underlight fills eye sockets and knuckle creases; warm interior spill paints a soft amber edge on shoulder and fingers, specular highlights tracing wet stone as the air haze drifts. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight haze. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
