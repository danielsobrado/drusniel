# Chapter 2.1 | The Empty Days

---

Three days after the trial, Drusniel stopped leaving his room.

The compound had food delivered. Water. Clean clothes. Everything he needed to survive without facing anyone. His mother left trays outside his door. His father said nothing. Shyntara knocked twice on the first day, then stopped trying.

He preferred it this way.

The training room adjoined his quartersâ€”a private space his family had built for honing knife work and silent movement. Drusniel used it for something else now. He stood in the center of the bare stone floor and reached.

Not for Venemora. Not for blessing. Just reached, the way he and Annariel had practiced for years. Feeling for that familiar pressure at the edge of awareness, the sense of *almost* that had driven them to keep trying.

Nothing.

He reached again. Harder.

The void answered. That smooth absence where connection should live. Like pressing against a wall that shouldn't exist.

Drusniel's thumb tapped against his fingers. One, two, three, four. He'd been counting since he woke upâ€”steps, breaths, heartbeats. The numbers gave his mind something to hold besides the shape of what he'd lost.

*I did everything right.*

The thought circled back, as it had a hundred times since the trial. He'd prepared. He'd practiced. He'd felt the blessing approachingâ€”that wasn't imagination. Annariel's face had confirmed it. Something had been *there*, and then something had taken it away.

But what? How? The questions had no answers, and asking them changed nothing.

On the fourth day, he ventured into the compound's corridors.

A servant passed him in the hall. The woman's eyes slid over Drusniel like he wasn't there, then away. She quickened her pace. Drusniel heard her whisper to another servant at the corridor's end: "That's the one whoâ€”"

The sentence died unfinished. They both hurried away.

Drusniel stood alone in the hallway. Counting his heartbeats. Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five.

*Social death.* He'd heard the term before but never understood it. Failed candidates didn't just lose statusâ€”they became uncomfortable to look at. Reminders that the system could reject anyone. That Venemora's blessing wasn't guaranteed.

Nobody wanted to think about that. So nobody looked at him.

He returned to his room. Closed the door. Reached again.

Nothing.

On the fifth day, Shyntara caught him in the training room.

She moved silentlyâ€”of course she did, she was the family's bestâ€”but Drusniel felt the air shift when the door opened. A skill he'd developed in the grove, sensing changes in pressure. It still worked. Small comfort.

"You need to eat," she said.

Drusniel didn't turn around. "I ate."

"Half a roll. Yesterday." Her footsteps crossed the stone floor. "And you need to sleep. Father says you pace at night. He hears you through the walls."

*Father.* Who had expected this failure. Who had been proven right.

"I'm fine."

"You're not." Shyntara stopped behind him. Close enough that he could feel her presence, the warmth of another body in the cold room. "Drusniel. Look at me."

He turned. His sister's face held something he didn't expectâ€”not pity, not judgment. Concern. The same expression she'd worn when he was twelve and broken his wrist falling from a training apparatus.

"I did everything right," he said. The words came out cracked. "Everything, Shyn. I felt it working. And thenâ€”"

"Then it didn't work." Her voice was gentle but firm. "That happens. It doesn't meanâ€”"

"No." He stepped back. "You don't understand. It wasn't failure. It wasâ€”" He stopped. How could he explain the sensation of something being carved away? How could he describe reaching for a limb and finding only the memory of where it had been?

She wouldn't believe him. No one would.

"It was what?" Shyntara asked.

Drusniel shook his head. "Nothing. It doesn't matter."

"It matters to you. That's obvious." She reached for his arm, but he pulled away. "Talk to me. Or talk to Father. Orâ€”"

"There's nothing to talk about." His voice came out harder than he intended. "I failed. The assassin path was always my calling. Isn't that what Father said? Magic was a distraction. Now that's settled."

Shyntara's eyes narrowed. She recognized his father's wordsâ€”thrown back as a weapon.

"Fine," she said quietly. "Starve yourself. Pace all night. Pretend you're fine." She turned toward the door. "But when you're ready to stop lying to yourself, I'll be here."

She paused at the threshold. Her hand rested on the frame. For a moment, Drusniel thought she might turn backâ€”might say something else, something real.

Then her shoulders squared, and she was gone.

The door closed behind her.

Drusniel stood alone in the training room. The silence pressed against his earsâ€”thick, suffocating.

His thumb tapped against his fingers. Forty-seven. Forty-eight. Forty-nine.

He stopped counting. The numbers meant nothing anymore.

On the sixth night, something changed.

Drusniel lay in darkness, staring at the ceiling. His body ached from days of reaching, of failed practice, of sleeping in fragments between bouts of pacing. Food tasted like nothing. Colors seemed duller. Even his anger had gone flat, replaced by a gray exhaustion that wouldn't lift.

He closed his eyes. Not to sleep. Just to rest.

And felt it.

A flicker. A warmth at the edge of awareness. Distant, but unmistakable.

*Presence.*

Drusniel's eyes snapped open. His heart hammeredâ€”seventy-one, seventy-twoâ€”

The warmth pulsed again. Closer now. Like a voice calling through fog.

Impossible. The mages had isolated Annariel. No outside contact. That was the rule.

But the presence felt familiar. The texture of it, the specific warmth. Like a fingerprint Drusniel had memorized over years of secret practice.

Almost.

Something was different. A slight delay in the rhythm, like an echo arriving a half-beat late. But he was tired, and desperate, and it had been so long since he'd felt anything but emptinessâ€”

He reached toward it. Tentative. Afraid to hope.

The presence reached back.

And then, impossibly, a voice in his mind:

*Drusniel?*

His breath caught. His hands trembled against the bedsheets.

The voice sounded like Annariel. Felt like Annariel. Close enough that the differences didn't matter.

*Annariel?*
