1. filename: dusty-storage.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Hollow, blank stare, shoulders collapsed, hands still stained with dried blood he can’t place anymore. Forgotten underground storage chamber: dust coats old crates and broken shelving, cobwebs in corners, air thick with drifting motes; he sits slumped against a stone wall in silence so complete it feels physical. Weak spill light from a side passage is the only diegetic source, falling in a cold strip across crates and catching dust as floating points while the rest of the room sinks into shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: spider-life.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A spider crossed the floor.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on a small gray spider crossing a dusty stone floor, tiny legs stepping over grit and hairline cracks; in the blurred background, a faint smear of dried blood and scattered dust suggests recent violence without showing it directly. Cold spill light from the passage creates a thin highlight on the spider’s back and a sharp miniature shadow beneath it; everything beyond falls into soft blur. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slight dust on lens, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mental-comfort.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The familiar warmth brushed against his awareness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] A brief softening—relief and exhaustion leaning into comfort—before suspicion can catch up. Narrow stone tunnel as Drusniel pauses mid-climb toward the surface passages, one hand braced on the wall, head tilted as if listening to a voice only he can hear. Cold blue-green ambient glow from fungal stains fills the tunnel, but a small amber bioluminescent lichen patch near his hand throws a warmer, intimate spill across his cheek that feels slightly wrong against the cold. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: wyrmreach-vision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "You could make them pay for everything they took from you.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Numbness snapping into rage and resolve, eyes sharpening, jaw tightening as the word *revenge* finally sticks. Tight waist-up in the tunnel: dried blood on his hands, fingers hovering near the too-pristine dagger at his hip; dust motes float as the passage behind disappears into darkness. A distant torch or lantern from the surface route provides a hard warm edge light that sharpens his profile; cold fungal ambient fill keeps the tunnel blue-green, turning the dust into mixed amber and cyan points. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: walking-away.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He walked.")
prompt:Rear three-quarter shot of Drusniel walking alone down a long underground passage toward faint surface light, one hand adjusting the dagger at his belt; old stone walls cracked and dusted, grit lifting with each step. Cold pale light ahead pulls him forward in a thin beam, while the tunnel behind falls into warm-and-cool patchwork from distant torches and fungal stains, emphasizing isolation and forward motion. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight motion blur in drifting dust, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
