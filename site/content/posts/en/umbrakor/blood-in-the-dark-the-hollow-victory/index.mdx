## Chapter 6.6 | The Hollow Victory

---

*Drusniel*

---

Drusniel emerged from the tunnels into a forgotten storage chamber. Dust on every surface. Crates that hadn't been moved in decades. Air that tasted of age and neglect.

Silence so complete it pressed against his ears like water.

He sat down against a wall.

He didn't think. Didn't plan. Didn't do anything except exist in the hollow space where his life used to be.

Blood dried on his hands. His mother's blood, maybe. Or Meren's. Or his own, from the nosebleed that had finally stopped. He couldn't remember anymore. Couldn't separate one loss from another. It was all the same red. All the same death.

A spider crossed the floor in front of him. Small. Gray. Moving with patient purpose toward some destination he would never understand. Some tiny life continuing in a world that had ended.

He watched it until it disappeared into a crack in the wall.

Then he stood.

---

The presence found him as he was climbing toward the surface passages.

*Drus.*

The familiar warmth brushed against his awareness. Reaching through the numbness. Reaching through the dark.

*Drus, are you alive? I felt something terrible. I've been trying to reach you for hours.*

He reached back toward the connection. The effort felt like lifting stones with broken hands.

*I'm alive.*

*Thank the deep gods.* Relief flooded through the mental link—warm and genuine and exactly what he needed to feel. *What happened? I felt pain, fear, then nothing. The connection just... stopped. I thought you were—*

*They're dead.*

Silence. The warmth dimmed, became something softer. Grief, maybe. Or the performance of grief.

Then, gentler: *Your parents?*

*Everyone. Everyone is dead.* His mental voice cracked. He felt the fracture lines running through himself, the places where he might shatter if he pressed too hard. *House Vrinn—they came in the night. Professional. Coordinated. They killed the servants first. Then they found my parents.*

*I'm so sorry.* The presence wrapped around him, warm and comforting. *I'm so, so sorry, Drus. I can't imagine—I don't have words. Your mother, your father—they were good people. They didn't deserve—*

Something flickered wrong in the warmth. A fraction of a second where the grief felt performed rather than felt. Where the phrases seemed chosen rather than spoken.

Then it passed, and the comfort resumed.

*No one deserves what happened.* The words came out flat. Empty. *But they're dead anyway. Meren's dead. Veyla's dead. Everyone who ever smiled at me in that compound is dead, and I couldn't do anything to stop it.*

*You survived.* The voice was firm now. Steady. *That matters. You survived, and that means their killers haven't won. Not yet.*

Drusniel leaned into the comfort. Let it hold him the way his mother's arms never would again. The warmth felt real, even if something in the back of his mind whispered that it was wrong. That it had always been wrong.

He ignored the whisper. He'd been ignoring it for weeks.

*I don't know what to do,* he sent. *I don't have anywhere to go. The compound is gone. My family is—*

*Go to Zaelar.*

The response came after a pause—half a heartbeat too long, as if the voice was checking something before speaking.

*What?*

*Go to Zaelar. He has resources. Protection. He can keep you safe while you figure out what to do next.* A pulse of urgency wound through the warmth. *And Drus... he can help you get revenge.*

Revenge.

The word cut through the numbness like a blade through fog. Revenge for his mother, lying at the base of the stairs with her cold hands and empty eyes. Revenge for his father, falling under three swords while his children ran. Revenge for Meren, and Veyla, and everyone who had died because House Vrinn decided the Thel'varins were in their way.

*Zaelar offered me a way to get stronger,* Drusniel sent slowly. The thoughts were crystallizing now. Taking shape. *Wyrmreach. He said the power I could gain there—*

*Yes.* The presence brightened with something that might have been hope, or might have been satisfaction. *Yes, Drus. Wyrmreach. You could become something House Vrinn has never faced. Something they couldn't stop. Something beyond their reach, beyond their understanding. You could make them pay for everything they took from you.*

The logic was seductive. Simple. Go to Zaelar. Accept the mission. Cross to Wyrmreach. Gain power beyond anything a drow could normally achieve.

Then return. And burn House Vrinn to the ground.

*What about you?* Drusniel asked. *If I go to Wyrmreach—*

*I'll be here. Waiting. Training.* A thread of sadness wound through the warmth. *We'll be separated for a while. But it's worth it, isn't it? To avenge your family? To become strong enough that no one can ever do this to you again?*

Worth it. Yes. That was the only thing left that might be worth anything.

*I'll go,* Drusniel sent. *To Zaelar. Tonight.*

*Good.* The presence began to fade, as it always did. *Be careful, Drus. The surface is dangerous, even for someone like you. And remember—whatever happens, whatever you have to do to get stronger... I'm with you. Always.*

The warmth withdrew.

Drusniel stood alone in the storage chamber, surrounded by dust and silence and the weight of everything he'd lost.

His family was dead. His home was ash. The life he'd known was over.

But he had a direction now. A purpose. A path toward something that might, eventually, fill the hollow space that had opened in his chest when he watched his father fall.

The Vrinn dagger pressed against his hip. Too clean. Too convenient. The doubt flickered once more—the analytical part of his mind that had noticed the anomaly and been drowned by grief.

He let it drown again. Or tried to.

He turned toward the surface passages. Toward Zaelar's tower. Toward Wyrmreach.

Toward something that felt like purpose, even if purpose wasn't quite the right word.

The doubt flickered beneath the rage—too clean, too convenient, something wrong with the evidence—but he buried it again. Buried it under grief. Under the need to move. Under the terrible weight of having nowhere else to go.

He walked. That was all he could do. Walk, and let the questions wait.

They would keep.
