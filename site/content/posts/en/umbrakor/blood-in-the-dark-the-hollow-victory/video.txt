## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel pauses mid-climb, one hand braced on the wall as dust motes drift through cold tunnel air. His breath steadies, listening to something only he can feel.
[00:03-00:05] Warm amber glow brushes his cheek from a nearby lichen patch. His fingers hover over the dagger at his hip; the metal shifts with a soft scrape as his grip tightens.
[00:05-00:08] He turns toward the faint surface light and starts walking with new purpose, footsteps measured and relentless as the tunnel swallows the last warmth behind him.

Slow push-in from his hovering hand to his eyes as resolve hardens.
Audio: distant water drip, faint torch crackle far away, cloth rustle, metal scrape at the belt, slow controlled breathing, footsteps on stone. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
