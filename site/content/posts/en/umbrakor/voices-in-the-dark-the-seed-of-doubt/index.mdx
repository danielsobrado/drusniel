## 2.3 | The Seed of Doubt

---

The messages came more frequently over the next two days.

Not constantly—the connection seemed to require effort on both ends. But each night, the presence would flicker at the edge of Drusniel's awareness. Each night, he would reach toward it, and each night, "Annariel's" voice would fill the silence.

They talked about the trial. About Drusniel's isolation. About his family's awkward attempts at normalcy. The presence was warm, concerned, focused on solving the problem in all the right ways.

And slowly, relentlessly, it pushed him toward Zaelar.

*The mages here discuss blocked candidates,* the voice said on the second night. *It's rare, but it happens—or so the theory goes. When someone powerful enough wants to prevent a candidate from passing.*

Drusniel lay in darkness, staring at the ceiling. *Blocked. You mean deliberately.*

*It's one possibility.* The presence pulsed with something like urgency. *Think about it. What you described—feeling the connection form and then simply finding no response—that's not how natural failure works. There might be a method. A technique.*

*But why me? I'm not a threat to anyone. I'm nobody.*

A pause. When the voice returned, it was careful. Measured.

*You're thorough. You ask questions others don't think to ask. You notice patterns.* Another pause. *Maybe that's enough. Maybe someone saw a candidate who wouldn't just accept the outcome and move on.*

The implication hung in the air—but the voice hadn't committed to it. Theory, not fact.

*You think someone might have deliberately blocked me because I ask questions?*

*I think it's worth considering. And Zaelar might understand the method better than anyone in the temple system—if the method even exists.*

It was the third time in two nights that the conversation had curved back to the surface mage. Drusniel noticed the pattern. Filed it away.

On the third night, he tested something.

The presence arrived as usual—a warmth at the edge of awareness, followed by words pressed into his mind like fingerprints.

*How are you holding up?*

Drusniel didn't answer right away. Instead, he did what he and Annariel had done a thousand times in the grove. He tapped his thumb against his fingers. One, two, three. Slow and deliberate.

The old game. *Read me.*

A pause.

*You seem worried,* the voice said. *About the decision. That's understandable.*

Drusniel's stomach tightened. Wrong answer.

The real Annariel would have said: *Three taps—you're scared, not worried. Different thing entirely.* He would have known the code. They'd invented the system together over years of practice.

This voice knew what Drusniel felt. It didn't know *how* it knew.

*Drus?* The presence flickered with concern. *Are you alright?*

*Fine.* He kept his thoughts carefully neutral. *Just tired.*

The effort of holding back—of not asking why the test had failed, why the voice felt different—made his head throb. The connection pulsed with warmth, and fighting it felt like swimming against a current.

*You should rest. We can talk tomorrow.*

*No, I—* He hesitated. Pushed down the doubt. *Tell me more about Zaelar. What else have you heard?*

The presence strengthened, as if relieved by the change of subject.

*He's powerful. That much is clear. The mages here speak of him in whispers—some say he was exiled from Umbra'kor decades ago. Others say he left by choice.* A pause. *I don't know which is true. I only hear fragments, pieces of conversations I'm not supposed to overhear. But they say he understands magic the way a smith understands iron. Not just how to use it—how it works. How it breaks.*

*How it breaks.* The words landed heavily.

*If someone blocked your connection to Venemora—and that's still an if—Zaelar might recognize the method. The signatures. He might be able to tell you whether what happened was natural or not.*

Drusniel closed his eyes. The doubt still gnawed at him—the wrongness of the empathy test, the strange pattern of every conversation returning to the same name. But beneath the doubt, something larger pulled at him.

*Answers.*

He wanted them more than he wanted safety. More than he wanted to stay hidden in his room, counting heartbeats, waiting for his father to remake him into an assassin.

*There's something else,* the voice said carefully. *I didn't want to say it before. I wasn't sure how you'd take it.*

*Say it.*

*The candidates who get blocked—if that's what happened—it's usually because someone thought they'd be trouble.* The presence pulsed with measured conviction. *Not weak candidates. Not the ones who would have failed anyway. The ones who might have been too effective. Too capable of noticing things.*

The implication hung in the air.

Drusniel felt the pull of it—the seductive suggestion that his failure proved his worth. That he'd been too much of a threat to let pass.

But the voice hadn't said it directly. It had left the conclusion for him to reach.

*You think I might have been blocked because I was dangerous?*

*I think it's worth considering. And I think if anyone can figure out the truth, it's you.*

The words should have been comforting. Instead, they left a strange taste in Drusniel's mind. Like a meal that looked right but smelled wrong.

*I know what's best for you now,* the voice had said the night before.

Annariel had never spoken like that. He'd never claimed to know what was best. Their friendship had been built on equality—two boys reaching for something beyond their station, neither one leading the other.

But grief changed people. Isolation changed people. Maybe training was reshaping Annariel into someone more confident, more directive.

Or maybe—

Drusniel pushed the thought away before it could fully form.

*I'll find him,* he sent. *Zaelar. I'll go to the surface.*

The words left his mind before he could stop them. And even as they did, something cold settled in his stomach. He didn't trust this. The failed test. The wrong memories. The pressure that always led to the same name.

But he was going anyway. Because the alternative was nothing.

*Good.* The presence warmed with approval. *You're making the right choice.*

But even as he accepted the praise, something coiled in his stomach. The empathy test. The wrong memory. The way every conversation led to the same destination.

He was choosing to go. That part was real. But he wasn't choosing because he believed. He was choosing because he had nothing else.

*Goodnight,* he sent into the fading warmth.

No answer. The presence was already gone.

He lay in darkness, alone again, the doubt coiled in his stomach like a snake.

Something was wrong. He could feel it.

But the pull toward answers was stronger than the whisper of warning. And somewhere on the surface, a mage named Zaelar was waiting.
