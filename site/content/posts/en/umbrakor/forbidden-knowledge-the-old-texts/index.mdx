## Chapter 7 | Part 6

--- 

The library smelled of dust and something older—preservation oils, fungal treatments, the accumulated breath of centuries pressed between leather covers.

Drusniel ran his fingers along spines he couldn't read. Three weeks of training, and Zaelar had finally brought him here: a circular chamber at the tower's heart, lined floor to ceiling with texts that predated anything in Umbra'kor's archives.

"These predate Venemora's arrival." Zaelar stood by a reading table, arranging hourglasses with the methodical precision he brought to everything. "Before your people forgot what they could be."

"Forgot?"

"Venemora brought divine blessing. Structure. Order." He turned an hourglass, watching sand begin to fall. "She also brought narrowing. Before her, drow practiced elemental magic freely. Air, water, fire, earth—all paths open. After her arrival, only her blessing mattered. Everything else became heresy."

Drusniel pulled a volume from the nearest shelf. The binding cracked under his touch, pages brittle with age. Symbols covered the margins—some vaguely familiar, most completely alien.

"I can't read this."

"No. The old script died with the old ways." Zaelar crossed to him and took the book gently. "But I've spent decades translating what matters. The essential knowledge." He gestured toward a side table stacked with loose pages. "My notes. Everything I've learned about elemental affinity among the drow."

Drusniel moved to the table. The papers were organized with obsessive precision—diagrams, annotations, measurements and timelines. Some bore Zaelar's cramped handwriting. Others looked older, copied from sources Drusniel couldn't identify.

"The last one with your particular affinity," Zaelar said quietly, "was named Velryn. Three centuries ago. Air and water both, like you."

"What happened to her?"

Zaelar's pause lasted a beat too long. "That's... complicated. She achieved great things. Changed the shape of the war between surface and underground. The records describe abilities most mages would consider impossible."

"And then?"

"Then she vanished." He set the old book aside. "The histories disagree on whether she died or simply... left. Her story is incomplete."

Drusniel filed that away. Zaelar's evasions always contained truth and omission in careful measure. The skill was learning which was which.

A name caught his eye.

His own name.

*Drusniel Thel'varin—elemental potential confirmed—air dominant, water secondary—trial timeline viable—projected outcome: likely failure (pattern suggests recoverable)*

Dated three months before the Duskborn Trials.

His throat went dry. "What is this?"

Zaelar's attention shifted to the page in Drusniel's hands. For a moment—just a moment—something flickered behind his eyes. Not guilt. Something closer to calculation, quickly masked.

"My research notes. I told you I've been watching promising candidates for years."

"You knew about me." Drusniel's voice came out flatter than he intended. "Before the trial. You knew I would fail."

"I suspected you might fail. The elemental purity is too strong for Venemora's blessing to recognize—I've seen it before." Zaelar moved closer, his tone patient. "I was going to approach you afterward, regardless of outcome. Offer training. Help you understand what you actually are."

"Projected outcome." Drusniel held up the page. "That's not suspicion. That's prediction."

"I've studied this long enough to recognize patterns." Zaelar's hands folded behind his back. "The outcome I expected came to pass. That doesn't mean I caused it—only that certain affinities follow predictable trajectories."

The explanation made sense. It fit the facts Drusniel already knew. And yet—

*Projected outcome: likely failure.*

Not possible failure. *Likely.* As if the result had been calculated in advance—not certain, perhaps, but close enough.

"You're the first in generations with this combination," Zaelar continued, his voice softening. "Do you understand how valuable that makes you? Not to Venemora's system. Not to elders who measure worth by their narrow standards. To anyone who understands what elemental magic can truly become."

Valuable. The word sat strangely in Drusniel's chest. Flattery and warning, braided together.

"Keep studying." Zaelar gestured toward the stacks. "I have preparations to make for tomorrow's lesson. You've earned access to this room, Drusniel. Use it."

He left. The door closed with a soft click.

Drusniel stood alone among the ancient texts, staring at his own name in Zaelar's handwriting.

*Projected outcome: likely failure.*

The power was real. He'd bent candle flames, felt air move at his suggestion. Whatever Zaelar's motives, the magic wasn't a lie.

But the note predated everything. Before the trial. Before the voice. Before Drusniel had made any choice at all.

He tucked the page into his sleeve and continued reading.
