## Chapter 5 | Part 2

--- 

His father was waiting at the compound gate.

Drusniel saw him from fifty paces away—a dark silhouette against the bioluminescent glow of the family estate. Arms crossed. Stance wide. The posture of a man who had been expecting bad news and received it.

The walk from the trial chamber had taken an hour. Drusniel had traced every crack in every wall he passed—obsidian veins, bioluminescent seams, the imperfections that made each tunnel distinct. The patterns meant nothing except that his mind needed something to hold.

His father didn't move as Drusniel approached. Didn't speak. Just watched with eyes that had evaluated a thousand targets and found most of them wanting.

Drusniel stopped three paces away. Proper distance for addressing the head of House Thel'varin.

"So." His father's voice was flat. "The trial."

Not a question. He already knew.

"I failed."

The word tasted like ash. Drusniel forced himself to hold his father's gaze. Assassins didn't look away. Even failed ones.

Something moved behind his father's eyes. Not surprise—he'd been prepared for this. Not disappointment—that would require him to have expected success. Something closer to resignation. The expression of a man whose warnings had been ignored, and who took no pleasure in being right.

"Come inside," his father said. "Your mother is waiting."

The compound felt smaller than Drusniel remembered. Training yards, pale gardens, the main house—all the same, but tonight it pressed in on him. A cage with its door swinging open.

His mother stood in the entry hall. Her face was carefully blank, the way it always got when she was processing something she didn't want to feel. Drusniel's gaze found the doorframe—old wood, familiar grain, a crack he'd traced since childhood. Still there. Still the same.

Shyntara stood beside her, arms folded, eyes sharp.

"Drusniel." His mother crossed to him and touched his face. Her hands were cool. "You're home."

"Mother, I—"

"It's done." She cut him off gently. "You're home. That's what matters."

That wasn't what mattered. What mattered was the void where Venemora's blessing should have been. What mattered was Annariel's face as the door closed between them. What mattered was the shape of something *taken*.

But his mother had already turned away, and his father was watching him with that evaluating stare, and Drusniel understood: they weren't going to ask what happened. They didn't want to know.

"The assassin path," his father said, "was always your true calling. Magic was a distraction. Now that's settled."

*Settled.* As if years of secret practice, of reaching for something greater, could be dismissed in a single word.

Drusniel's hands clenched at his sides. "Something went wrong in there. The trial—I felt it working. Then it just—"

"It didn't work." His father's voice hardened. "That's what failure means. You gambled time you should have spent training, and you lost. Now that's done. We move forward."

*Move forward.* As if years of reaching could be discarded like a failed contract.

"I'm not—"

"Where have you been sneaking off to?"

Shyntara's voice cut through the tension. She hadn't moved from her position by the wall, but her eyes had locked onto Drusniel with predatory focus.

"What?"

"Before this. The past few months." She pushed off the wall and approached. "You've been disappearing. Coming home with spore burns on your clothes. Taking routes through the fungal farms that don't lead anywhere I know of." She stopped an arm's length away. "Where have you been, brother?"

Drusniel's heart hammered. His eyes found the wall behind Shyntara—a crack running diagonally toward the ceiling. He traced it. Traced it again.

"Nowhere. Training."

"Training." Shyntara's mouth curved. Not a smile. "In the fungal farms. Alone."

"I needed space. To practice the trial forms." The lie came easier than it should have. "Away from..." He gestured vaguely at the compound. "All this."

Shyntara held his gaze for a long moment. Her expression said she didn't believe him. Her silence said she was choosing not to push. For now.

"Children." Their mother's voice carried an edge of warning. "Enough. Tonight is not the night for this."

"She's right." Their father moved toward the corridor that led to his study. "There are other matters to discuss. Come. Both of you."

Drusniel followed, grateful for the escape from Shyntara's scrutiny. His sister fell into step behind him. He could feel her attention on his back like a blade's edge.

His father's study was a narrow room lined with weapons. Knives of every design hung from pegs on the walls—curved, straight, serrated, smooth. Trophies from three generations of successful contracts. Drusniel had learned to identify each one by sound before he turned twelve.

"Close the door," his father said.

Shyntara did.

Their father stood behind his desk, hands flat on the scarred wood surface. His jaw worked silently for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was lower than before. Careful.

"What I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room. Your mother knows. No one else."

Drusniel exchanged a glance with Shyntara. Her expression had shifted—still sharp, but focused now on their father instead of him.

"The rival house," their father said. "They've been making moves. Territory contested. Contracts diverted. The old enemy—you know which one. Their patience is ending."

Shyntara leaned forward. "What do we do?"

"Stay alert. No one leaves alone. Something is coming."

Drusniel listened to them talk—patrol schedules, defensive positions, the logistics of a war he didn't understand. His father and sister spoke the same language, moved in the same rhythm. The language of assassins.

He'd never belonged here. And now he didn't belong anywhere else, either.

"Stay close to home," his father said finally, meeting Drusniel's eyes. "All of you. Whatever happened at the trial—forget it. Your family needs you here."

He almost said it then. Almost told them that something had been *wrong*, that he'd felt the blessing approaching before it vanished. But his father was already turning away. Already moving on.

They'd never believed in him. Why would they start now?

Drusniel stood in his father's study while the conversation washed over him.

His best friend was gone. His magic was gone. His future—the one he'd chosen—was gone.

And somewhere outside these walls, the rival house was circling. A danger that had nothing to do with failed trials or stolen blessings.

He traced the blade-marks on the study walls. Let his family plan for their war.

The void in his chest felt larger than any of it. A hollow where something had been carved away—and in its place, only the certainty that he had never been enough.
