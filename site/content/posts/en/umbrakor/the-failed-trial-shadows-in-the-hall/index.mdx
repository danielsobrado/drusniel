# Chapter 1.4 | Shadows in the Hall

---

His father was waiting at the compound gate.

Drusniel saw him from fifty paces away—a dark silhouette against the bioluminescent glow of the family estate. Arms crossed. Stance wide. The posture of a man receiving a report he'd already anticipated.

The walk from the trial chamber had taken an hour. Drusniel had counted every step. Two thousand, three hundred and forty-seven. The number meant nothing except that his mind needed something to hold.

His father didn't move as Drusniel approached. Didn't speak. Just watched with eyes that had evaluated a thousand targets and found most of them wanting.

Drusniel stopped three paces away. Proper distance for addressing the head of House Thel'varin.

"So." His father's voice was flat. "The trial."

Not a question. He already knew.

"I failed."

His throat constricted around the word. Drusniel forced himself to hold his father's gaze. Assassins didn't look away. Even failed ones.

His father's expression didn't change. No anger. No disappointment. Just the same measured assessment he brought to contract negotiations.

"The records will reflect the outcome," his father said. "That's what matters now. Come inside."

The compound felt smaller than Drusniel remembered. Training yards, pale gardens, the main house—all the same, but tonight it pressed in on him. His chest felt tight, his breathing shallow.

His mother stood in the entry hall. Her face was carefully blank, the way it always got when she was processing something she didn't want to feel. Shyntara stood beside her, arms folded, eyes sharp.

"Drusniel." His mother crossed to him and touched his face. Her hands were cool. "You're home."

"Mother, I—"

"It's done." She cut him off gently. "You're home. That's what matters."

That wasn't what mattered. What mattered was the warmth that had been there and then wasn't. What mattered was Annariel's face as the door closed between them. What mattered was understanding why.

But his mother had already turned away, and his father was watching him with that evaluating stare, and Drusniel understood: they weren't going to ask what happened. They didn't want to know.

"The assassin path remains open," his father said. "The trial's outcome changes the timeline, not the destination."

*Timeline.* *Destination.* Speaking of his life like a logistics problem.

Drusniel's hands clenched at his sides. "Something went wrong in there. The trial—I felt it working. Then it just—"

"The records say you failed." His father's voice carried no heat. "What you felt doesn't appear in any ledger. The houses that matter will see the outcome. The rest is noise."

The words landed like stones. *What you felt doesn't appear in any ledger.*

"I'm not—"

"Where have you been sneaking off to?"

Shyntara's voice cut through the tension. She hadn't moved from her position by the wall, but her eyes had locked onto Drusniel with predatory focus.

"What?"

"Before this. The past few months." She pushed off the wall and approached. "You've been disappearing. Coming home with spore burns on your clothes. Taking routes through the fungal farms that don't lead anywhere I know of." She stopped an arm's length away. "Where have you been, brother?"

Drusniel's heart hammered. Seventy-one. Seventy-two.

"Nowhere. Training."

"Training." Shyntara's mouth curved. Not a smile. "In the fungal farms. Alone."

"I needed space. To practice the trial forms." The lie came easier than it should have. "Away from..." He gestured vaguely at the compound. "All this."

Shyntara held his gaze for a long moment. Her expression said she didn't believe him. Her silence said she was choosing not to push. For now.

"Children." Their mother's voice carried an edge of warning. "Enough. Tonight is not the night for this."

"She's right." Their father moved toward the corridor that led to his study. "There are other matters to discuss. Come. Both of you."

Drusniel followed, grateful for the escape from Shyntara's scrutiny. His sister fell into step behind him. He could feel her attention on his back like a blade's edge.

His father's study was a narrow room lined with weapons. Knives of every design hung from pegs on the walls—curved, straight, serrated, smooth. Trophies from three generations of successful contracts. Drusniel had learned to identify each one by sound before he turned twelve.

"Close the door," his father said.

Shyntara did.

Their father stood behind his desk, hands flat on the scarred wood surface. His jaw worked silently for a moment. When he spoke, his voice was lower than before. Careful.

"What I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this room. Your mother knows. No one else."

Drusniel exchanged a glance with Shyntara. Her expression had shifted—still sharp, but focused now on their father instead of him.

"The rival house," their father said. "They've been making moves. Territory contested. Contracts diverted. The old enemy—you know which one. Their patience is ending."

Shyntara leaned forward. "What do we do?"

"Stay alert. No one leaves alone. Something is coming."

Drusniel listened to them talk—patrol schedules, defensive positions, the logistics of a war he didn't understand. His father and sister spoke the same language, moved in the same rhythm. The language of assassins.

He'd never belonged here. And now he didn't belong anywhere else, either.

"Stay close to home," his father said finally, meeting Drusniel's eyes. "All of you. Whatever happened at the trial—the record exists. That's the reality now. Your family needs you focused on what's real."

*The record exists. That's the reality now.*

Drusniel stood in his father's study while the conversation washed over him. The message was clear: truth didn't matter. Only what was written down. Only what the houses could see.

His best friend was gone. Whatever he'd felt in the chamber no longer responded the same way. His future—the one he'd chosen—existed only as a failed entry in someone's ledger.

And somewhere outside these walls, the rival house was circling. A danger that had nothing to do with failed trials or unexplained outcomes.

He counted his heartbeats. Let his family plan for their war.

The empty space in his chest felt larger than any of it. Only a dull, restless pressure remained.
