# Chapter 1.1 | The Sacred Chamber

---

Drusniel pressed his back against the antechamber wall and counted his heartbeats. Forty-seven. Forty-eight. The obsidian was cold through his thin ceremonial robe.

Annariel crouched beside him, fingers drumming against his knee. "You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"Counting." Annariel's mouth curved. "Your lips move."

Drusniel forced his jaw still. Fifty-three. Fifty-four. He'd lost track anyway.

The antechamber stretched before them, carved from the living rock of Umbra'kor's deepest reaches. Bioluminescent fungi clung to the ceiling in pale clusters, casting the dozen other candidates in sickly blue-green light. Most sat in tight groups, whispering prayers to Venemora. A few stood alone, eyes closed, breathing the patterns their families had drilled into them since birth.

Drusniel and Annariel sat apart from all of them.

"Shyntara followed me to the market district," Drusniel said quietly. "I had to double back through the fungal farms."

"Did she see you leave the city?"

"No. I made sure." He'd spent an extra hour in the spore-heavy tunnels, taking routes even his sister's trained eyes couldn't track. His lungs still burned from it. "She suspects something."

"She always suspects something. It's her job." Annariel shifted closer, dropping his voice. "We're here now. That's what matters."

Here. In the sacred antechamber. Waiting for the Duskborn Trials to begin.

If his father knew, he'd drag Drusniel home by his hair. The Thel'varin family produced assassins, not mages. Three generations of shadow-killers, and Drusniel was supposed to continue the tradition. Follow Shyntara's path. Learn the blade, the poison, the silent step.

Not this.

Never this.

"Think of a number," Annariel said.

Drusniel closed his eyes. The game was their oldest secretâ€”something they'd stumbled into years ago in the hidden grove, trying desperately to feel any whisper of magic. It wasn't real power. Not the kind Venemora granted. But it was *something*.

He thought of his mother's face this morning. The way she'd looked at him over breakfast without really seeing him. Already planning his training schedule with Shyntara. Already writing him into a future he didn't want.

"Seven," Annariel said.

Drusniel opened his eyes. "How?"

"Your thumb." Annariel nodded toward Drusniel's hand. "You tap it against your fingers when you're thinking about family. Seven taps. One for each year since your grandmother died."

"That's notâ€”" Drusniel stopped. Looked at his hand. His thumb rested against his index finger, frozen mid-tap. "I didn't know I did that."

"I know." Annariel's grin faded into something more serious. "That's why it works. We know each other's patterns. The tells nobody else sees." He paused. "It's the closest thing to magic we've ever managed."

The closest thing. Years of secret practice in the grove, reaching for power that never came. Years of studying stolen texts, memorizing techniques meant for candidates with Venemora's blessing. Years of hoping that maybe, somehow, they could force their way into something greater.

And Venemora had never reached back. Not once. Drusniel had felt her presence in the ritual spacesâ€”distant, vast, indifferentâ€”but never *for him*. She watched everyone. She chose few. And nothing in all their practice had ever made him feel chosen.

Now the Trials would make that official. One way or another.

"If they catch us," Drusniel said. "Attempting the ritual without the blessingâ€”"

"They won't catch us." Annariel's voice carried more confidence than his eyes. "We've practiced. We know the forms. The blessing is just... permission. A formality."

"A formality that every other candidate in this room has."

"And we have something they don't." Annariel tapped his temple. "We have each other. Whatever this thing between us isâ€”this connectionâ€”it's *real*. I can feel your patterns. You can feel mine. That has to count for something."

Drusniel wanted to believe it. Gods, he wanted to believe it.

A priest emerged from the inner chamber, robes trailing shadow that moved wrong in the fungal light. The whispered prayers fell silent. Even the air seemed to still.

"Candidates." The priest's voice carried without effort, filling the antechamber like smoke. "The Duskborn Trials commence. Venemora watches. Venemora judges. Those she finds worthy shall receive her blessing and join the ranks of the Shadowed."

Those she finds unworthy. The priest didn't need to say the rest. Everyone knew. Failed candidates returned to their families in disgrace. Their magical potentialâ€”whatever small amount they possessedâ€”would wither. They'd spend their lives as merchants, laborers, or if they were lucky, servants to the very mages they'd failed to become.

Or assassins. Like Father wanted.

"First trial," the priest continued. "Reach for the goddess. Let her see your devotion. Let her feel your worth."

The candidates began filing toward the inner chamber. Drusniel's legs didn't want to move.

"Hey." Annariel gripped his arm. "We've trained for this. Every night in the grove, reaching for something we couldn't name. Now we finally get to try for real."

"We've been practicing without her blessing, Ann. Without permission. What if sheâ€”"

"What if she rewards us for trying?" Annariel's grip tightened. "What if all those nights actually taught us something the others don't know? We learned to reach *without* help. Maybe that makes us stronger."

Or maybe it made them heretics. Drusniel didn't say it.

"This is our chance." Annariel released him and stood. His smile flickeredâ€”there for a moment, then held in place by effort. "A chance to be more than what they planned for us. More than assassins. More than merchants' sons. More than *average*."

The word hit like a blade between ribs. Average. Drusniel's father had never said it directly, but the implication lived in every lesson, every disappointed glance, every comparison to Shyntara. *Why can't you be more like your sister? Why can't you just accept what you are?*

Because average wasn't enough. It had never been enough.

Drusniel stood.

They joined the line of candidates filing toward the inner chamber. The obsidian walls pressed close, carved with Venemora's symbolsâ€”eyes within eyes, shadows consuming shadows. The fungi grew thicker here, their light dimmer, until the candidates walked through a darkness that felt almost alive.

At the threshold, Annariel caught his hand. Just for a moment.

"Whatever happens in there," he said quietly. He paused. Swallowed. The confidence from before sounded thinner now, rehearsed. "I'll find you after. We started this together. We finish it together."

Drusniel squeezed back. Then let go.

The priest's voice echoed from somewhere ahead, ritualized words older than the city itself:

"The trials commence. May Venemora find you worthy."

Drusniel stepped into the darkness.

He let himself believe it might actually work. He had to. They'd practiced for years. They'd learned to reach.

But as the shadows closed around him, something flickered at the edge of his awareness. A pressure. A stillness. Like the moment before a blade fallsâ€”when the air itself holds its breath.

He reached for the feeling, tried to name it.

Nothing. Just the ordinary darkness of the passage ahead.

Drusniel shook it off and kept walking.
