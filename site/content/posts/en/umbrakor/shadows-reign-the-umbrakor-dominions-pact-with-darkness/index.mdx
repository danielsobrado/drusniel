The initiate's hand shook as she copied the passage.

Sylaera had been transcribing temple records for six weeks. Most of the work was tedious: census figures, tribute tallies, the endless documentation of debts owed between houses. But this text was different. This text was old.

*The transition from surface to depths occurred gradually. Some records suggest centuries passed between the first descent and the final abandonment of the upper world. Other sources claim the change was swift—a single generation, a single choice, a door that closed and never reopened.*

She paused. The marginalia in the original manuscript contained annotations from at least three different hands, their ink faded to different shades of brown.

*This contradicts the Temple account. —M.V.*

*The Temple account is doctrine. Contradiction is heresy. —unsigned*

*Then explain the surface artifacts in the Deepreach archives. —M.V.*

The response to that final note had been scratched out. Deliberately, it seemed. The paper was torn where someone had pressed too hard.

> *"In darkness, we found power. In isolation, we found strength. In Venemora, we found purpose."*

The proverb hung above the transcription chamber in letters of phosphorescent crystal. Sylaera had read it a thousand times. She'd believed it, once—before she started reading the source texts that the proverb supposedly summarized.

The source texts didn't agree with each other. They barely agreed with themselves.

Some described Venemora as a goddess encountered in the depths. Others spoke of her as something the drow brought with them from the surface—a faith that adapted to darkness rather than originating from it. A third tradition, preserved only in fragments, suggested Venemora was neither goddess nor faith but something more troubling: a presence that had been waiting in the caverns long before the first drow descended.

The temple taught the first version. The others were filed in the restricted archives, available only to senior priestesses and their designated scribes.

Sylaera was a designated scribe. She wasn't sure anymore whether that was a privilege or a punishment.

> *"In the game of houses, you rise or you fall. There is no middle ground."*

The matriarch's words were accurate, at least. That much Sylaera had seen firsthand. Three houses had fallen in the last decade. Their members absorbed, scattered, or simply vanished. The records listed them as *dissolved by mutual consent*. The reality, she suspected, was messier.

But the houses weren't her concern. The Rift was.

The patrol reports had crossed her desk by accident—misfiled among temple correspondence, addressed to a priestess who'd died two months previously. Sylaera should have forwarded them to the appropriate authority. Instead, she read them.

*Patrol Seven reports unusual emanations from the eastern boundary. Pattern does not match previous observations. Recommend increased monitoring.*

*Patrol Seven lost contact on day forty-three. Recovery team found equipment intact. No bodies recovered. No signs of combat. Recommend investigation.*

*Investigation postponed due to resource allocation. Patrol Seven listed as missing, presumed lost to environmental hazard.*

Three reports. Three months apart. The pattern was familiar—she'd seen similar sequences in the older records. Patrols that encountered something unusual near the Rift. Follow-up teams that found nothing. Quiet reassignments of personnel. Questions that stopped being asked.

Sylaera completed her transcription and filed the original text back in the restricted archive. Her hands no longer shook. You grew accustomed to uncomfortable knowledge, she was learning. You filed it away in a part of your mind that didn't interfere with daily function.

The Rift was stable. The temple assured everyone it was stable. The drow had guarded it for centuries. They would guard it for centuries more.

But the patrol reports kept coming. And the restricted archive kept growing. And somewhere in the depths, beyond the last caverns where any drow traveled willingly, something continued to change in ways the official records refused to describe.

> *"The Shadowblades move unseen, strike unheard, and leave no trace but the bodies of their enemies."*

A comforting saying. Sylaera wondered, sometimes, whether the Shadowblades themselves believed it. Whether anyone who'd actually stood at the Rift's edge still believed in clean victories or traceless departures.

She returned to her assigned work. Census figures. Tribute tallies. The endless documentation of debts.

The temple bells rang the evening hour. In the transcription chamber, the phosphorescent letters continued to glow: *In darkness, we found power.*

Sylaera copied the words one more time, and wondered what else they'd found.
