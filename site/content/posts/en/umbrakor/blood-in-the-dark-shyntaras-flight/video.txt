## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Shyntara stands at the garden edge, staring back as flames surge and smoke climbs toward the cavern ceiling. Embers drift past her face.
[00:03-00:05] A distant timber snaps and collapses inside the compound. She wipes at the blood above her eye, then turns sharply as if catching movement in the air.
[00:05-00:08] She breaks into a sprint along the wet stone path, firelight shrinking behind her as she vanishes toward the tunnel mouth swallowed by darkness.

Slow pull-back revealing the burning compound behind her as she moves.
Audio: roaring fire, ember hiss, distant collapse crack, wet stone footsteps, cloth flutter, controlled breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
