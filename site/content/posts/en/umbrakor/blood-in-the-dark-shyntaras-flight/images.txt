1. filename: assessing-rubble.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Cold calculation over panic, blood from a cut above her eye, breathing controlled as she measures time and routes. Smoke-dim corridor facing a collapsed ceiling that blocks the passage completely—rubble and snapped beams piled high, dust drifting down in slow sheets onto wet stone. A faint blue-green fungal wash in wall cracks gives cold ambient fill; a distant torch or small fire provides weak warm flicker that catches on drifting dust and broken timber edges. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: silent-kill.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "She'd killed three of them already—quick, efficient strikes from the shadows, the training their father had drilled into her since childhood.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Emotionless focus, eyes locked, body moving with practiced economy. Stealth kill in the servants’ wing: Shyntara steps out of shadow behind a professional attacker and finishes the strike in one controlled motion, using the cramped corridor and smoke residue as cover; the target’s armor is practical and scuffed, no house colors visible. Low torch/lantern flicker provides warm, intermittent highlights on steel and wet stone while the rest falls into deep shadow; smoke breaks the light into streaks that emphasize the speed of her movement. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mercenary-corpse.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "These fighters had none of that. No flourishes. No tells. No personality.")
prompt:Forensic close shot of a dead attacker on stone: plain utilitarian armor and gear with no house colors, no family sigils, no decorative marks—just worn straps, scuffed metal, and practical kit; weapon dropped where it fell. Torchlight from down the hall gives warm raking highlights that reveal scratches, grime, and stitching while the corner behind drops into heavy shadow; smoke haze softens the far edges. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: burning-compound.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The compound burned behind her.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Restrained grief turned into urgency, chin lifted, eyes reflecting fire as she refuses to stop moving. Exterior outer gardens under a cavern ceiling: Shyntara stands at the edge of the paths looking back at her family compound burning, smoke climbing and spreading in the still air, embers drifting through haze. Orange firelight is the dominant diegetic source, reflecting off wet stone and catching on her eyelashes; faint cool bioluminescence in the garden plants adds a thin blue-green rim along the ground and stone edges. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight haze. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: entering-tunnel.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Shyntara slipped into the tunnel and disappeared into darkness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Listening hard, head turned a fraction as she checks for pursuit; posture low and ready, gear dusted with ash. Shyntara enters a hidden tunnel mouth in a stone wall, one boot already inside the black while the burning compound glow fades behind her; belt blades and a small pack visible in the edge light. Firelight behind provides warm rim illumination that outlines her profile and gear straps; the tunnel ahead remains nearly black with only faint cold reflections on wet stone. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
