## Chapter 7 | Part 1

--- 

The tower was older than it had looked from the hillside.

Up close, Drusniel could see where dark stone had cracked and been repaired, where vines had climbed and been cut away, where centuries of weather had worn the edges smooth. The structure rose four stories into the gray sky, its windows dark, its door standing open.

He stopped at the threshold and tracked a fracture line in the stone where old repairs met older rock. The habit steadied him.

The walk had taken two hours. Two hours of gray light and unfamiliar air, of flinching at sounds he couldn't identify. Birds, he'd realized eventually, though the word didn't capture the strangeness of creatures that flew through open sky instead of crawling through tunnels. The surface was wrong in ways he couldn't name—too vast, too empty, too exposed.

But the tower felt different. Contained. Almost familiar.

Drusniel stepped inside.

The entry hall was dim, lit by candles in iron brackets. His eyes adjusted quickly—at least something still worked the way it should. Shelves lined the walls, crammed with books in languages he couldn't read. The air smelled of dust and old paper and something else. Something sharp. Chemical.

And everywhere, hourglasses.

They sat on shelves, on tables, on windowsills. Dozens of them. Hundreds. Some as small as his thumb, others large enough to hold a fist. Sand trickled through glass in different colors—white, black, red, gold. Measuring... what? Time, obviously. But so much time, tracked so precisely.

"You arrived faster than I expected."

Drusniel spun toward the voice.

A drow stood at the top of a spiral staircase. Tall, gaunt, with white hair that hung past his shoulders. His robes were dark and simple. His eyes caught the candlelight and reflected it back—violet, shifting toward silver as he descended.

"I am Zaelar." His voice was measured. Calm. Almost gentle. "And you must be Drusniel."

The name landed wrong. Drusniel hadn't introduced himself. Hadn't spoken at all.

"How do you know my name?"

Zaelar reached the bottom of the stairs. His movements were deliberate, unhurried. "Annariel mentioned you might seek me out. He reached me several days ago—asked if I would receive a friend who needed answers." A faint smile. "I've been hoping someone like you would find their way here."

Someone like him. The words echoed strangely.

Drusniel scanned the room again. The candles were fresh. The floors were clean. A tea service sat on a small table near the stairs—two cups, still steaming.

Two cups.

"You were expecting me," Drusniel said slowly.

"I was hoping." Zaelar gestured toward the table. "Please. Sit. You've come a long way, and the surface can be disorienting for those raised below."

Drusniel didn't move. He let his eyes go to the details instead: fresh candles, steaming tea, two cups. The pattern was too neat.

This was wrong. All of it. The preparation, the timing, the way Zaelar spoke his name like they'd met before. "Annariel" had mentioned Zaelar, but how had Zaelar known when Drusniel would arrive? How had he known to prepare tea for two on this specific morning?

But the alternative was turning back. Walking away from the only person who might have answers.

Drusniel sat.

Zaelar poured tea with steady hands. The liquid was dark, fragrant, unfamiliar. "The surface blends are different from what you're used to. This one is meant to settle the stomach. Surface exposure can be... unsettling."

"I'm fine."

"Of course you are." Zaelar settled into the chair across from him. "Annariel seems to think highly of you. He asked specifically if I would help."

The compliment landed like the others—too smooth, too well-aimed. Drusniel wrapped his hands around the warm cup and said nothing.

"You failed the Duskborn Trials," Zaelar said. Not a question. "You felt Venemora's blessing approaching, and then—an interruption. A discontinuity. The connection failed to complete."

Drusniel's grip tightened on the cup. "How do you know that?"

"Because I've seen it before." Zaelar's violet eyes held his gaze without wavering. "The blessing didn't reject you, Drusniel. Something interfered. Something blocked what should have been yours."

The words were exactly what Drusniel needed to hear. Exactly what he'd believed since the trial chamber. And that precision felt dangerous—like a key cut to fit a lock no one should have measured.

"Annariel told you all this?"

"Annariel told me you were special." Zaelar lifted his own cup, sipped, set it down. "That you deserved answers. The rest..." He gestured at Drusniel with one long-fingered hand. "The rest I can see for myself."

An hourglass on the nearest shelf ran out. The last grains of red sand fell into the lower chamber, and for a moment, the silence in the room felt absolute.

Then Zaelar reached over and flipped it. The sand began to fall again.

"You measure everything," Drusniel said.

"Time is the only resource that cannot be recovered." Zaelar's smile was thin. "I've learned not to waste it. Which brings us to you." He leaned forward slightly. "You came here seeking answers. I can offer them—but first, I need to understand what you are."

"What I am?"

"What kind of magic lives inside you." Zaelar extended his hand, palm up. "May I?"

Drusniel stared at the offered hand. Every instinct told him this was a trap. The preparation, the knowledge, the perfectly calibrated words—Zaelar knew too much. Moved too smoothly. Everything about this tower screamed that Drusniel was being handled.

But the void in his chest still ached. And somewhere beneath the suspicion, a desperate hope whispered: *What if he can actually help?*

Drusniel reached out and placed his hand in Zaelar's palm.
