1. filename: burnt-tower.jpg
role: header
prompt:Photorealistic wide dawn establishing shot of Zaelar's lonely stone tower at the edge of a forest clearing: lower walls blackened with scorch marks, front door hanging crooked on broken hinges, one outbuilding collapsed into smoking timbers; wet grass and trampled soil in the clearing while ash drifts through cold air. Pale sunrise slices through thin smoke from camera left, cool highlights catching damp stone while warmer edges glow along the smoke. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: zaelar-singed.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Zaelar appeared in the broken doorway.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] Photorealistic, controlled relief that never fully softens; pale eyes sharp and calculating, robe hem singed, fresh cut along his cheek, ash smeared on one sleeve. Zaelar stands in the broken doorway framed by splintered wood and cracked stone as smoke curls past the threshold and the ruined clearing sits behind him in soft blur. Cold dawn backlight silhouettes drifting smoke, while a single interior candle or lantern throws warm amber up onto his jawline and the edge of his cut with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, natural skin texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shared-enemy.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "They came for me as well.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro detail of fresh scorch marks blackening rough stone and a splintered doorframe, burn edges still dusty with soot; twisted hinges and nail heads half-buried in char while a faint ember glows in a collapsed timber nearby. Hard dawn side light rakes across the texture, catching wet sheen on damp grit and turning ash specks into bright points against matte black burn. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slight vignetting. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: allies-handshake.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "That makes us allies.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] Photorealistic, intent and steady; grip firm on the shoulder, gesture almost fatherly but controlling. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Hollow exhaustion with grief crystallizing into resolve; eyes hardening, posture barely held upright. Tight two-shot at the ruined threshold as Zaelar steadies Drusniel and draws him inside, smoke curling through the broken doorway while scorched stone and a collapsed outbuilding blur behind them. Cool dawn light from outside outlines their profiles, while warm interior lantern spill adds amber to knuckles and cheekbones with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: entering-ruin.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel followed him through the broken door.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Photorealistic, tense profile and shallow breathing; eyes scanning damage while he steps carefully. Just inside the broken door, Drusniel steps over crunching glass into Zaelar's violated study: papers scattered with writing not readable, books yanked from shelves, hourglasses ticking on a shelf, and an overturned instrument half-buried in debris. A cold shaft of dawn light cuts through dust and smoke, while a single candle on a desk adds weak warm glow that catches floating motes and the edge of broken glass. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around the candle, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
