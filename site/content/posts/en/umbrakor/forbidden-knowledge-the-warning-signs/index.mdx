## Chapter 4.3 | The Warning Signs

---

The letter was wedged between two volumes on elemental theory—probably misfiled, probably forgotten. Drusniel almost didn't notice it.

But the paper was different. Newer. And the handwriting, when he unfolded it, was Zaelar's.

*The candidate progresses as anticipated. Elemental affinity confirmed—air dominant, water secondary. Intervention re: trial—outcome as projected. Subject believes failure was systemic incompatibility. Mental contact protocol initiated through compromised channel. Timeline acceleration possible if family situation deteriorates.*

Drusniel read it twice. Three times. The words didn't change.

*Intervention re: trial—outcome as projected.*

His hands trembled. He folded the letter carefully, tucked it into his sleeve beside the page with his name on it, and continued shelving books as if nothing had happened.

Zaelar returned an hour later, carrying two cups of tea.

"You've been productive." He set one cup on the reading table. "Find anything interesting?"

"Plenty." Drusniel accepted the tea. The cup was warm in his hands. "Old histories. Techniques I don't understand yet. And this."

He held up the letter.

Zaelar went still. For a moment—just a moment—something flickered behind his eyes. Irritation. Not at being caught. At being questioned. The micro-expression of a man whose student had overstepped some invisible line.

Then it was gone, replaced by understanding.

"Ah. That correspondence." He set down his own cup. "I should have filed that more carefully."

"Intervention re: trial." Drusniel kept his voice level. "What does that mean?"

"It means exactly what you suspect." Zaelar settled into his chair with the deliberate calm of someone who had anticipated this conversation. "Your trial was interfered with. You've suspected that since the beginning. I've been investigating who and why."

"You wrote 'subject believes failure was systemic.' You're talking about me. As if I'm—" He stopped. Breathed. "As if I'm a specimen."

"I was documenting your case for analysis. Emotional language clouds investigation." Zaelar's tone was patient, reasonable. "That letter was to an associate who helps me track movements within Umbra'kor's hierarchy. I needed to establish what you believed so I could understand how the deception was constructed."

"Mental contact protocol." Drusniel's throat tightened. "The voice. The messages I thought were from Annariel. You know about those."

"I know someone is communicating with you through a compromised channel, yes." Zaelar leaned forward slightly. "I've been trying to trace the source. Whoever sabotaged your trial is still manipulating you, Drusniel. That's what I'm trying to uncover."

The explanation fit. It addressed his questions. It made Zaelar an ally rather than a threat.

And yet.

"You knew about me before the trial," Drusniel said slowly. "You predicted I would fail. You have notes dated months before we met. And now you're telling me you're investigating the sabotage—as if you weren't involved in it."

"I wasn't." Zaelar's voice went softer. More earnest. "I've been watching promising candidates for years, Drusniel. When I learned your trial had been compromised, I saw opportunity—not to harm you, but to help. To reach you before whoever was manipulating you could complete their work."

"Why would anyone manipulate me?"

"Because you're valuable." He gestured toward the ancient texts surrounding them. "Air and water affinity, pure and strong. The first in generations. There are people who would kill to control someone with your potential. Others who would kill to prevent you from reaching it."

Drusniel stared at the letter in his hands. The explanation was plausible. The logic held together. But something beneath the surface felt wrong—the same wrongness he'd felt in the voice's messages, the same careful construction of reasonable answers.

"I could leave," he said. "Stop coming here. Return to my family and forget any of this happened."

"You could." Zaelar's expression didn't change. "The power would remain. You'd have to discover its limits on your own, without guidance. And whoever sabotaged your trial would still be out there, still working whatever plan made you their target."

"Or you could be the one who sabotaged me. And this is all—" Drusniel stopped.

All what? A trap? The magic was real. The training was real. Whatever Zaelar's motives, the power in Drusniel's hands wasn't a lie.

"The choice is yours," Zaelar said quietly. "I won't stop you if you want to leave. But ask yourself—what do you gain by walking away? And what do you lose?"

Drusniel looked at the letter. At the shelves of ancient knowledge. At his own hands, where faint energy had flickered that morning when he'd caught a draft without thinking.

The tightness was almost gone. The power had filled its place. And whatever truth lay beneath Zaelar's careful explanations, that filling wasn't something he was willing to give up.

"I'll stay," he said.

Something that might have been satisfaction crossed Zaelar's features.

"Good. We have much work still to do."

That night, the presence returned.

Drusniel lay in darkness, exhausted from practice, and felt the familiar warmth at the edge of his awareness. The texture that felt almost like Annariel.

*Drus. I heard you had a difficult day.*

He stiffened. *Heard from whom?*

*Zaelar mentioned it. We've been in contact.* The voice pulsed with sympathy. *He's worried about you. He says you found something that upset you.*

*A letter. About my trial.* Drusniel chose his words carefully. *It mentioned sabotage. Mental contact protocols.*

*I know.* A pause, weighted with something that might have been guilt. *I should have told you sooner. I've suspected someone was interfering with us. With our connection. But I couldn't prove anything.*

*You knew the connection might be compromised?*

*I feared it might be. The way our messages sometimes felt... off. I thought I was imagining things.* A pause—longer than natural, as if the presence was consulting something Drusniel couldn't see. *Zaelar is trying to help. He's trying to find who did this to both of us. Trust him, Drus. I do.*

Trust him. The words echoed in Drusniel's mind. The voice wanted him to trust Zaelar. Zaelar wanted him to distrust the voice. Both were asking for faith while offering explanations that fit together almost too neatly.

*I'm tired,* he sent. *I need to rest.*

*Of course.* The presence began to fade. *We'll talk soon. I'm proud of you, Drus. You're becoming something extraordinary.*

The warmth withdrew.

Drusniel lay in darkness, counting heartbeats. One hundred three. One hundred four. One hundred five.

The power was real. That much he could trust.

Everything else was shadows.
