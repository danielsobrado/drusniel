1. filename: letter-examined.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Controlled shock, hands trembling as he opens the letter; breath caught, eyes locked on the page. He unfolds a newer sheet found wedged between dusty books in a cramped library alcove; handwriting is present but unreadable.
Environment: Tall shelves of leather-bound elemental theory volumes and loose pages crowd the frame. Single oil lantern is the only light, warm amber pooling on parchment texture and catching dust motes; amber highlights skim the underside of fingers and knuckle ridges, and warm reflections bounce off varnished wood shelf edges. Background shelves fall to deep shadow, with soft falloff and visible film-like grain.
Camera: Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 macro GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: zaelar-explanation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The explanation fit.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Deliberate calm, eyes cold behind patience, one hand mid-gesture. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Suspicion tightening his mouth, shoulders braced, letter held near the table edge. Two cups of tea steam between them as the conversation turns sharp.
Environment: Old library study lined with ancient volumes, cluttered reading table with scattered papers and stacked books; any writing stays unreadable. Single table lamp is the primary light, warm amber carving cheekbones and throwing hard shadows into the shelves. Lamp glass blooms with slight halation; warm light reflects off wood grain and ceramic, creating dull specular highlights on cup rims.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: mental-contact-doubt.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Trust him. The words echoed.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Wary exhaustion, eyes open and fixed, jaw set; fingers gripping the sheet until knuckles tighten. He lies awake as a familiar warmth presses at the edge of awareness.
Environment: Bare stone bedroom, rumpled bedding creased under tense hands. Thin cold corridor light leaks under the door as a narrow strip; a tiny bedside candle ember adds weak warm amber, painting a faint glow along one cheek while the rest of the room drops to black. Warm highlights catch pores and sweat sheen; shadows are deep and soft-edged, with low-light grain.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: cracked-ceiling.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel lay in darkness, eyes fixed on a thin crack in the stone above him.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Eyes wide with sleepless focus, hands slowly steadying on the blanket, breathing measured. Low angle from the pillow looking up at a thin crack running across rough stone ceiling like a fault line.
Environment: Dust drifting in still air. Cold blue moonlight from a high slit window traces the crack and rims the edge of his face; a weaker warm spill from the door gap fades across the bedding. Blue highlights sharpen stone grit texture; warm and cool light meet on the blanket, creating mixed color shadows at edges.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, slightly underexposed, natural low-light grain. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: shadows-remain.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Everything else was shadows.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Hollow-eyed fatigue, shoulders slumped; staring at his own hands as if testing what is real. He sits on the edge of the bed with the letter beside him, forcing himself steady.
Environment: Near-total darkness. Main illumination is a thin cold corridor light line under the door; a weak candle glow adds soft warm highlights on fingertips and paper edges. Candle flame bends slightly with a draft, and dust haze hangs in the air catching faint points of light. Corners of the room vanish into black, with film-like grain and soft falloff.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
