1. filename: waking-to-silence.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Panic forced into motion, eyes watering, jaw clenched; one hand trailing the wall, the other pressed over his mouth as he runs blind. Smoke-choked compound corridor with dead bioluminescent lights, damp black stone sweating, silhouettes smearing into violence through chemical haze. Distant torch/firelight flickers through smoke into broken amber bands; faint blue-green fungal stains add cold rim highlights along the wall and drifting soot, specular glints sliding on wet stone as he passes. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: smoke-in-corridor.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The corridor was a nightmare of smoke and screaming.")
prompt:Empty corridor perspective swallowed by thick chemical smoke, visibility reduced to a few steps; wet stone walls sweat with condensation, soot and dust floating in the air, distant shadows smearing past. Faint torch flicker far down the passage turns the haze into layered amber-grey planes; shadow bands ripple across floor grit as the smoke shifts, with occasional cold rim from fungal stains outlining wall edges. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: dead-lights.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Someone had planned this.")
prompt:Macro close-up of sabotaged bioluminescent wall growths—flower-like clusters with petals limp and dark, leaking faint residue as smoke curls around them; corridor behind dissolving into haze. Distant torch flicker gives minimal warm highlights on wet organic texture; a faint residual cyan stain traces torn petal edges and slick stone, interactive glints trembling as the smoke breathes past. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight dust on lens, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: assassin-shadow.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A shape loomed out of the darkness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Breath locked, eyes wide and unblinking, counting in his head; pressed into a shadowed alcove of an empty decorative niche. Masked armored assassin moves through the smoke with professional calm, blade already wet as it catches a brief glint, checking a side room and continuing. Firelight flashes warm on blade and armor edges; smoke eats detail into near-black, leaving only intermittent highlights and thick shadow swallowing the alcove. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: running-blind.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "His mother lay at the base of the stairs.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Mother]. Drusniel shock collapsing into denial, hands trembling as he reaches for her; Mother stillness, eyes open and unfocused, hair loosened. Main hall stairwell: blood spreading across stone like a dark mirror, smoke and distant combat shadows flickering behind. Torch/firelight throws harsh warm flicker that catches wet blood sheen and stone micro-texture; faint dying bioluminescent flower glow adds cold teal edge along her cheek and the stair lip, mixed-color reflections rippling across the pooled blood surface. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
