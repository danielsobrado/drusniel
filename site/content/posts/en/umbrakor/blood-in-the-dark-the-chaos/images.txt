1. filename: waking-to-silence.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Panic forced into motion, eyes watering, jaw clenched around a breath he can’t afford to take. Drusniel runs blind through a smoke-choked compound corridor, one hand trailing the damp stone wall for bearings, the other pressed over his mouth; bioluminescent lights are dead and silhouettes ahead smear into violence through chemical haze. Distant torch/firelight is the only warm source, flickering through smoke into broken amber bands; faint blue-green fungal stains in the stone add cold rim highlights along the wall and drifting soot. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: smoke-in-corridor.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "The corridor was a nightmare of smoke and screaming.")
prompt:Empty corridor perspective swallowed by thick chemical smoke, visibility reduced to a few steps; wet stone walls sweat with condensation while soot and dust float in the air, and distant shadows smear past like phantoms. A faint torch flicker far down the passage is the only diegetic light, turning the haze into layered amber-grey planes and casting soft, unstable shadows along the floor grit. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dead-lights.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Someone had planned this.")
prompt:Macro close-up of sabotaged bioluminescent wall growths—flower-like clusters with petals limp and dark, leaking faint residue as smoke curls around them; the corridor beyond dissolves into haze, emphasizing how total the blackout is. A distant torch flicker provides minimal warm highlights on wet organic texture while a faint residual cyan stain gives a cold edge along torn petals and slick stone. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight dust on lens, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: assassin-shadow.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A shape loomed out of the darkness.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Breath locked, eyes wide and unblinking as he counts in his head, trying not to exist. A masked, armored assassin moves through the smoke with professional calm, blade already wet as it catches a brief glint; Drusniel is pressed into a shadowed alcove—an empty decorative niche—while the killer checks a side room and continues. Firelight from deeper in the hall flashes warm across the blade and armor edges; smoke eats most detail, leaving only intermittent highlights and thick shadow swallowing the alcove. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: running-blind.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "His mother lay at the base of the stairs.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Shock collapsing into denial, hands trembling as he reaches for warmth that isn’t there. [Face_Reference: Mother] drow with blueish ash skin color, Stillness, eyes open and unfocused, hair loosened by violence. Main hall stairwell: Drusniel drops to his knees beside his mother at the base of the steps, blood spreading across the stone like a dark mirror, smoke and distant combat shadows flickering behind. Torch/firelight from the hall throws harsh warm flicker that catches wet blood sheen and stone texture; a faint dying bioluminescent flower glow nearby adds a cold teal edge to her cheek and the stair lip. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
