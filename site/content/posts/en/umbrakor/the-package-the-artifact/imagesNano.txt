1. filename: artifact-box.jpg
role: header
prompt:Photorealistic close-up on the preparation table in Zaelar's study as a protective case is set down among maps, provisions, and tools; inside rests a palm-sized dark metal plate covered in geometric symbols that seem to shift when looked at directly. The plate emits a faint pulse like a heartbeat, barely lighting the nearest paper fibers; a stubby candle pools warm amber across the table and throws interactive long shadows from scattered glass shards and an overturned tool. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the candle, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: opening-box.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "He opened the lid.")
prompt:Photorealistic top-down view of the open case on the table: the dark metal plate sits nested in worn lining, shifting geometric symbols catching light as if they move between angles; maps and a small pack crowd the edges of frame. The artifact's faint cool pulse paints a thin blue-grey sheen across the metal; candlelight adds warm amber rim that reveals scuffs, dust, and paper grain, with shadows staying soft and heavy in the room corners. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-touching.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Touch it.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on Drusniel's fingertip pressing a specific symbol on the metal plate, skin tension visible as he focuses; a thin distortion ripples outward like heat-haze and the candle flame in the background wavers. Cool pulse-light from the metal sits under the finger, while warm candlelight rakes across pores and etched edges, interactive highlights popping on micro-scratches and glass dust. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the candle, slightly out of focus background. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: weight-of-object.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Heavier than it looked.")
prompt:Photorealistic medium shot of Drusniel holding the protective pouch in one hand, fingers tightening as the weight surprises him; the small pack sits open on the table beside maps and provisions, the room still littered with glass and dust. Cold grey window light keeps the scene flat and sober; candlelight adds weak warm edge that catches worn stitching and scuffs on leather straps, interactive sheen revealing creases without making it glossy. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: hiding-artifact.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Keep it hidden.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: focused and controlled, hands deliberate as he hides the pouch without hesitating. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: watching with intent, eyes fixed on the transfer, unreadable. Medium two-shot in the wrecked study as Drusniel tucks the pouch into his pack and cinches the strap, Zaelar standing close enough to guide and close enough to control; maps and tools sit between them like a contract. Candlelight is the only warm source, amber reflections sliding across fingers and leather; cold window fill leaves the background flat and heavy with smoke haze. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the candle, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
