1. filename: sneaking-past-study.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: tense focus, breathing controlled; moving like a shadow in dark practical clothes.
Environment: Family compound corridor at the third hour past midnight. Warm lamp light leaks under his father's study door in a thin strip, throwing amber bands across worn stone; sparse cyan fungal clusters add cold fill that turns the shadows blue-green, with dust suspended in the mixed light.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: surface-door.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Marked with faded symbols.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Knuckles tight, grip firm; pausing with his palm on the cold handle at the threshold.
Environment: Close-up on a scarred service corridor door marked with faded warning symbols and protocols, a hairline crack in the stone beside the hinges. Cyan fungal light glances off worn metal and gritty stone, catching rust texture as tiny warm-cool specular flecks; the tunnel beyond falls to near-black with no bounce.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: stepping-out-gray.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Instead, he found gray.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Squinting into unfamiliar light, posture braced; stepping out with cautious determination.
Environment: Tunnel mouth opening onto a gray dawn, thick clouds pressing low over wet stone and gray trees with ash-colored leaves. Diffuse overcast daylight flattens shadows; moisture sheen on rock catches soft highlights and a thin mist softens the horizon into layered silhouettes.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: looking-back-tunnel.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Umbra'kor. His family. His old life.")
prompt: The tunnel entrance set into a rocky hillside, nearly invisible unless you know where to look; a black mouth swallowing all light against wet stone.
Environment: Gray dawn outside throws cold diffuse light across slick rock and sparse brush, but the interior remains pure darkness with no detail, creating a hard contrast where the underground reads like a sealed secret. Damp air hangs as a thin haze that softens the surrounding hillside.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight chromatic aberration at the frame edges. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: tower-horizon.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Standing alone on a hill")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Still and intent, scanning; a subtle shift from doubt to determination as he finds the tower.
Environment: Long view across rolling gray hills under heavy cloud. Overcast dawn desaturates the landscape; the tower reads as a near-black silhouette of sharp angles on a distant hill, softened by atmospheric mist, while wet grass and stone in the foreground catch faint cold highlights.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
