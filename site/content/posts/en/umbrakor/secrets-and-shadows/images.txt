role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Guarded expression, jaw tight, scanning the path ahead. Hooded cloak pulled low, spore dust on shoulders. Crouching mid-step through a bioluminescent fungal grove, thick mist pooling at ankle height, twisted root formations arching overhead, pale blue caps pulsing faintly on either side of a narrow trail. Bioluminescent fungi casting cold blue-violet light upward from the forest floor, catching the underside of his jaw and hood, mist scattering the glow into soft halos.

role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A few weak sparks.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Face scrunched in strain, veins visible at the temple, teeth clenched. Fingers splayed wide, two sputtering orange sparks dying between his knuckles, residual heat distorting the air above his palm. Standing in a hidden clearing surrounded by dense fungal growth, dark cavern ceiling barely visible above. The dying sparks casting brief warm flickers across his knuckles and chin, competing with ambient blue bioluminescence from surrounding fungi.

prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Eyes closed, brow furrowed in deep concentration, sweat beading at the hairline. [Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Facing him in profile, eyes wide with shock, mouth slightly open. Both seated cross-legged on moss-covered stone in a clearing, a faint thread of pale light connecting the space between their foreheads. The thread of light between them casting a thin white line across both faces, bioluminescent moss below reflecting pale green upward onto their chins.

4. filename: zaelar-rumor.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Whispers of torture chambers.")
prompt:A crooked tower of black stone rising above the fungal canopy, seen through a gap in the cavern ceiling. Barbed iron fixtures jutting from the walls, narrow slits for windows glowing a dull sickly amber. Viewed from far below through layers of mist and fungal overgrowth, distorted by distance and imagination. The amber glow from the tower slits cutting downward through drifting spore clouds, casting long jagged shadows across the fungal canopy below.

5. filename: father-disappointment.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "His father fixed him with a piercing stare.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father] drow with blueish ash skin color, Jaw set, eyes narrowed, the controlled stillness of a man who has killed professionally for decades. Seated at the head of a stone dining table, one hand flat on the surface. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Visible at the far end of the table, small in the frame, shoulders hunched. A narrow dining chamber, obsidian walls, weapons mounted above a low hearth. Candlelight from a cluster of tallow candles on the table casting upward shadows beneath the father's brow and cheekbones, Drusniel's end of the table falling into deeper shadow.
