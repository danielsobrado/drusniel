## Chapter 4

---

Drusniel slipped out of the family mansion before anyone stirred. The spore tunnels swallowed the sound of his footsteps. He took the long route — past the fungal farms, through the service passages nobody checked — because Shyntara had been watching him, and his sister noticed everything.

The grove was their place. Hidden between root systems so dense that even the city's patrols avoided it. Annariel was already there, fingers spread, face tight with effort.

A spark guttered from his fingertips. Died.

"You're late," Annariel said without looking up.

"By seconds." Drusniel checked behind him one more time. Old habit. "Shyntara's suspicious. Had to take the long way."

Annariel wiped his hands on his robe. "The Duskborn Trials are coming. If they catch us practicing without the blessing—"

"They won't." Drusniel sat across from him. "Let's try the numbers again."

Annariel closed his eyes. Drusniel reached — not physically, but with that strange inner sense they'd spent months learning to feel. A pressure at the edge of his awareness. The shape of Annariel's thoughts, blurred but present.

"Seven," Drusniel said.

Annariel opened his eyes. "How?"

"I don't know." And he didn't. The technique had no name. No text described it. They'd stumbled into it by accident and never managed to explain why it worked. "But it's something. Maybe enough."

They rested against a root system that curved overhead like a rib cage. The fungi above pulsed their dim light.

"Heard a rumor about Zaelar," Annariel said, keeping his voice low even though they were alone.

"The surface mage?"

"They say he has dungeons under his tower. That people go in and don't come out."

Drusniel traced a crack in the root beside him. "Stories. Meant to keep people underground where they belong."

"Maybe." Annariel pulled his knees up. "But his power's real. Everyone agrees on that much."

Silence settled between them. The fungi pulsed. Drusniel's thumb tapped against his fingers — four, five, six — a habit he didn't know he had yet.

"Do you ever wonder," he said carefully, "if the blessing isn't the only way?"

Annariel looked at him. "Don't say that at dinner."

"I'm serious. I've read things. Old texts, from before Venemora. Mages who didn't need a goddess to reach their power."

"Dangerous reading."

"Dangerous thinking." Drusniel picked at the edge of his robe. "But I can't stop. Something doesn't fit. The official story has gaps, Ann. Big ones."

Annariel didn't argue. That was the thing about him — he didn't dismiss what he couldn't disprove. He just sat with it, turning it over.

"One problem at a time," Annariel said finally. "Pass the trials first. Question everything after."

Sound advice. Drusniel filed it away and ignored it completely.

That night at dinner, his father studied him across the table.

"You seem distracted."

"Just thinking." Drusniel moved food around his plate.

"About what?"

He should have said *training*. Should have said *nothing*. Instead: "About life before the barrier. What our ancestors were like."

His father's fork stopped mid-cut. "Those times are gone. Our duty is to the present."

"But what if we're capable of more than—"

"Careful, brother." Shyntara's voice was flat. "That's the kind of question people don't come back from."

The table went quiet. Drusniel ate without tasting anything.

Later, alone in his room, he stared at the ceiling and traced cracks he knew by heart. One long. Two branching. A third that disappeared behind a shelf.

Shyntara was right. The question was dangerous.

He was going to ask it anyway.
