1. filename: forest-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Guarded expression, jaw tight. Hooded cloak pulled low, spore dust on shoulders. Crouching mid-step through a bioluminescent fungal grove, thick mist pooling at ankle height. Dense underground fungal forest, twisted root formations arching overhead, pale blue-violet caps pulsing on either side of a narrow trail, mist diffusing the glow into soft volumetric halos. Bioluminescent fungi casting cold blue-violet photons upward from the forest floor, light refracting through mist particulates and bouncing off the damp underside of his hood and jawline, subsurface scattering through the translucent fungal caps creating secondary diffused glow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible. Fungal caps: chitin-based bioluminescent tissue, translucent outer membrane with internal phosphorescent structures. Mist: water vapor condensate with suspended fungal spore particulates. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: failing-magic.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A few weak sparks.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Annariel]. Face scrunched in strain, veins visible at temple. Fingers splayed wide, two sputtering orange sparks dying between his knuckles. Standing in a hidden clearing surrounded by dense fungal growth. The dying sparks casting brief warm-spectrum flickers across his knuckle ridges and chin, orange light reflecting off the moisture on his skin while ambient bioluminescent blue from surrounding fungi fills the shadows, creating a warm-cold color split across his face. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Macro Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores. Sparks: incandescent particulate matter, sub-1000K thermal emission with rapid decay. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: mind-reading-success.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "It was seven, wasn't it?")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes closed, brow furrowed, sweat beading at the hairline. [Face_Reference: Annariel]. Facing him in profile, eyes wide with shock, mouth open. Both seated cross-legged on moss-covered stone, a faint thread of pale light connecting the space between their foreheads. The pale thread emitting soft white photons that cast a thin highlight across both brow ridges and bridge of the nose, bioluminescent moss below reflecting diffused green light upward onto their chins, the two light sources mixing on the skin at different angles. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed. Thread: coherent photonic filament, low-intensity luminous plasma with visible Rayleigh scattering along its length. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: zaelar-rumor.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Whispers of torture chambers.")
prompt: A crooked tower of black stone rising above the fungal canopy, seen through a gap in the cavern ceiling. Barbed iron fixtures jutting from walls, narrow slit windows glowing dull sickly amber. Viewed from far below through layers of mist and fungal overgrowth. Amber light from the tower slits cutting downward through drifting spore clouds, each particle catching and scattering the light as it falls, casting long jagged shadows across the fungal canopy, the black stone absorbing most incident light while iron fixtures produce faint specular reflections. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible. Tower stone: obsidian-like volcanic glass, low albedo, conchoidal fracture surfaces. Iron fixtures: oxidized ferrous metal, rough pitted surface with patina. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: father-disappointment.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "His father fixed him with a piercing stare.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Father]. Jaw set, eyes narrowed, controlled stillness. One hand flat on the stone table surface. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Visible at the far end, small in frame, shoulders hunched. Narrow dining chamber with obsidian walls and weapons mounted above a low hearth. Candlelight from tallow candles on the table casting warm upward shadows beneath the father's brow ridge and orbital bones, the light attenuating rapidly across the table leaving Drusniel's end in deeper shadow, obsidian walls producing faint specular reflections of the flame. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background. Obsidian walls: volcanic glass, high-gloss conchoidal fracture surfaces producing mirror-like specular reflections. Tallow candles: animal-fat based, warm-spectrum 1800K emission. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
