## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel and Annariel sit cross-legged facing each other on moss-covered stone. Drusniel's eyes are closed, brow furrowed. A faint thread of pale light flickers into existence between their foreheads, unstable, pulsing. Annariel's eyes snap wide open.
[00:03-00:06] The thread brightens and steadies. The pale light casts a thin white line across both faces. Annariel's mouth falls open. Drusniel's fingers twitch. The bioluminescent moss beneath them pulses brighter in response, green light washing upward.
[00:06-00:08] Drusniel opens his eyes. The thread dissolves into drifting motes of light that scatter and fade. Both boys stare at each other. The clearing returns to its ambient blue-green glow. A breath of wind stirs the spore dust around them.

Slow push-in from medium two-shot to close framing on both faces.
Audio: low cave ambience, dripping water, faint fungal hum building in pitch during the connection, sharp silence when the thread breaks. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
