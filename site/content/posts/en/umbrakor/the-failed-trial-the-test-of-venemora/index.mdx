# Chapter 1.2 | The Test of Venemora

---

The chamber doors groaned open. Drusniel's counting faltered—seventeen, eighteen—and he lost the thread of his heartbeats entirely.

The trial chamber sprawled before them, vast and dim. Obsidian columns rose toward a ceiling lost in darkness, their surfaces carved with prayers so old the language had died with its speakers. Pale fungi clung to the walls in measured clusters, casting the space in bruised purple light. At the chamber's heart, a circular platform of black stone waited beneath an altar shaped like folded wings.

Venemora's altar. Where the goddess would either claim them or turn away.

Drusniel found his count again. Twenty-three. Twenty-four.

Three mages stood near the altar in robes the color of dried blood. Their faces held the particular boredom of officials who had watched this ritual a thousand times. The lead mage—an ancient drow with white hair cropped close to her skull—consulted a list etched on slate.

"Annariel," she called, not bothering with his house name. "Step forward."

Annariel squeezed Drusniel's arm once, quick and hard. Then he walked toward the platform with his shoulders back and his chin raised. Playing confident. Drusniel knew better. He'd seen Annariel's hands shaking in the antechamber.

But their practice had worked. It *had*. All those nights in the grove, reaching for something they weren't supposed to touch—Annariel had grown stronger. His sparks had become flames. His reaching had found purchase.

Annariel knelt on the platform. Closed his eyes.

The mages watched with the enthusiasm of people observing paint dry.

Drusniel held his breath. Counted the seconds. One. Two. Three. Four—

A shimmer passed through the air above the altar. Faint, like heat rising from summer stone. Annariel's hands unclenched. His breathing steadied.

"Adequate connection," one of the mages murmured to another. "He'll do."

That was it. No fanfare. No blessing descending in light. Just *adequate* and *he'll do*, and Annariel opened his eyes with tears streaming down his face because he understood what Drusniel understood: they had done the impossible. Their forbidden practice, their secret grove, their years of reaching without permission—it had worked.

Annariel rose on unsteady legs. His eyes found Drusniel's across the chamber. *We did it*, that look said. *Your turn.*

"Drusniel of House Thel'varin," the lead mage called. Her tone suggested she was already thinking about her midday meal. "Step forward."

His legs moved. The obsidian floor felt too smooth beneath his feet, too cold. He counted his steps—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven—until he reached the platform.

The stone was warm where Annariel had knelt. Drusniel settled into that borrowed warmth and closed his eyes.

*Reach*, he told himself. *Just like we practiced. Feel for her blessing.*

He had learned what to expect. In their secret sessions, he and Annariel had catalogued every sensation: first the resistance, like pushing through water. Then the pressure building at the edges of awareness—the divine presence acknowledging the attempt. Finally, if you were worthy, the resistance would thin. The warmth would build. Connection.

He reached.

Resistance met him immediately. Normal. Expected. He pushed through it, feeling the familiar density give way—

There. The presence. Distant but real, like a voice calling through fog. Venemora's blessing, the thread of divine power that would make him a mage. Closer than he'd ever felt it. The resistance was thinning. The warmth was building.

He stretched toward it.

The blessing moved closer. Closer. He could almost—

No response.

He reached and his hand closed on empty space. The warmth had been there, a heartbeat away, and now there was no feedback. No resistance. No pressure at all.

Drusniel paused. Adjusted his technique. Reached again.

The same result. No resistance. No feedback. The sensation of pushing against nothing.

Third attempt. He changed nothing—same approach, same form. Identical outcome.

His counting stuttered. Lost the numbers. He searched for the familiar presence of potential and found only stillness—like the memory of a limb that had been there moments ago.

He opened his eyes.

The mages weren't looking at him with shock. They weren't exchanging meaningful glances. The ancient one had already checked something off her slate and was scanning for the next name on her list.

"No connection," one of the other mages noted. He might have been commenting on the weather. "Mark it. Another from the martial houses."

"Consistent with the averages," the third mage said, already looking past Drusniel to the next candidate.

Drusniel's ears rang. His hands had gone numb against the warm stone.

"Failed." The lead mage didn't even look up from her slate. "Next candidate."

*Failed.*

The word didn't make sense. Their practice had worked—he'd just watched it work for Annariel. He'd felt Venemora's blessing approaching. It had been *right there*.

He stood. His legs felt borrowed, operating on someone else's commands. He looked toward Annariel, who stood with the other successful candidates near the chamber's far wall.

Annariel's face had gone the color of old ash. His mouth hung slightly open. His eyes were fixed on Drusniel with an expression Drusniel had never seen before: pure, undiluted horror.

Because Annariel knew. They had practiced together. They had reached together. They had both touched that presence in the dark.

The result didn't match the process.

Drusniel made himself walk toward the exit. The other candidates—the failed ones, the line he now belonged to—shuffled ahead of him in silence. Their faces held defeat, resignation, the ordinary grief of people who had tried and come up short.

That didn't match what failure was supposed to feel like. Drusniel hadn't come up short. He had reached and there had been no response. The warmth had been there and then it hadn't.

He looked back once. Annariel was still staring at him. Mouthing something that might have been *I'm sorry* or might have been *what happened* or might have been nothing at all, just the shape of confusion on a friend's lips.

A mage took Annariel's arm and steered him toward a different door—toward the training halls, toward the future they had planned to share.

The lead mage's voice echoed through the chamber. "Merinaal of House—"

Drusniel didn't hear the rest. He was counting his heartbeats again, clutching that small discipline like a rope in darkness.

Sixty-seven. Sixty-eight. Sixty-nine.

The numbers meant nothing. They changed nothing. But they gave his mind something to hold besides the pattern of what had happened.

He had reached for it. It had been there.

Then there had been no response.

Unless he'd imagined it. Unless desperation had conjured the sensation of Venemora's approach—a phantom blessing for a boy who wanted it too badly. Maybe there had never been anything there, and he'd only felt what he needed to feel.

But Annariel's face stayed with him. That horror. That recognition.

Annariel had watched him practice. Annariel knew.

The result didn't match the process.
