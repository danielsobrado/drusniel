1. filename: smoke-under-door.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Instant dread, eyes watering; body leaning forward into a run before thought catches up. Service passage inside the compound: chemical smoke seeping under a reinforced door seam and rolling along the floor, bioluminescent corridor lights dead, damp black stone sweating, air thick enough to taste. Weak distant emergency lantern throws warm flicker that turns the smoke into layered amber-grey bands; faint blue-green fungal stains add cold edge highlights along floor grit and doorframe, specular glints sliding on wet stone as the smoke moves. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: assassin-attack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A shape materialized from the smoke.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Pure survival focus, eyes wide, breath tearing; twisting low as the strike whistles past. Masked armored assassin lunges out of chemical smoke, blade rising; corridor walls tight and close, smoke streaking to show speed. Dropped torch or shuttered lantern provides warm flicker that glints on blade edge and beads in the smoke; the rest of the corridor stays near-black, with faint cold rim from fungal residue outlining armor edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: air-magic-defense.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "The attacker stumbled back.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Desperation into grit, teeth clenched; fresh blood at his nose as he thrusts a hand forward. Compressed air burst forces a single-step stagger from the assassin, smoke snapping sideways and briefly clearing a cone down the corridor. Warm torch/lantern flicker and faint cyan fungal wash strobe through moving smoke, hard highlights skating on armor edges and wet stone while dust becomes bright amber needles in the air. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in whipping smoke. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: dead-servant.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "A servant's body lay crumpled.")
prompt:High-angle corridor junction: servant’s body crumpled on the stone, eyes open, throat cut, a dropped keyring half-buried in dust; chemical smoke pools near the floor and climbs the walls in slow curls. Distant torch flicker is the only warm light, catching glossy wet patches on stone and turning smoke into amber layers; faint blue-green fungal stain adds cold edge highlights along the body outline and corridor lip, reflections trembling on damp rock as the haze shifts. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: ceiling-collapse.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "The ceiling collapsed.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Shyntara]. Drusniel shock and refusal, arms up shielding his face; Shyntara battle focus mid-turn, reaching back as she pivots toward the attackers. Stone and timber crash down between them, debris exploding outward, dust swallowing the frame while a slice of Shyntara remains visible through haze on the far side. Torchlight and small flames in the rubble throw harsh warm flicker that catches flying dust and sparks; cold cyan fungal residue rims falling stones and adds thin edge highlights on armor plates. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, fast-shutter feel with slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
