## Chapter 7 | Part 15

--- 

The sound came from downstairs.

Breaking glass. Then silence. The kind of silence that meant something terrible was happening too fast to make noise.

Drusniel was on his feet before he understood why. His body knew before his mind caught up—training, instinct, the survival response his father had drilled into all of them since they were children.

*Something is wrong.*

He grabbed the knife from his bedside. Not much, but better than nothing. The air in the room felt different. Heavier. The bioluminescent lights flickered once, twice—

Then died.

Darkness.

Drusniel's drow eyes adjusted quickly, but the quality of the dark had changed. Smoke. He could smell it now, seeping under his door. Taste it in the back of his throat, acrid and chemical. Not natural smoke. Something designed to blind and confuse.

*This isn't a drill. This isn't practice. This is real.*

He moved to the door. Pressed his ear against the wood. Listened.

Footsteps in the corridor—multiple, coordinated, too heavy to be servants. The measured tread of professionals who'd done this before. Voices, low and professional, communicating in hand signals and whispers.

"Check the upper floors. No survivors."

His blood went cold.

*No survivors.*

The door burst open.

Drusniel moved without thinking. He felt the air displacement before he saw the figure—his new sense screaming *threat*—and threw himself sideways as a blade cut through the space where his head had been. Close enough to feel the wind of its passage.

He rolled. Came up low. The attacker was armored, face hidden behind a featureless mask, moving with trained precision. Professional. Expensive. The kind of assassin houses hired when they wanted a job done right.

Drusniel lashed out with his knife. Too slow. The attacker caught his wrist, twisted—

Pain. Bright and hot, shooting up his arm. The knife clattered away into darkness.

*The air. Use the air.*

He reached for the current from the window—the draft that always blew through this corridor—but panic scattered his focus. The air wouldn't gather. He could feel it, sense it, but his mind was fragmented by fear and pain and the certain knowledge that he was about to die—

*Focus. FOCUS.*

He tried again. Gathered what he could find, compressed it the way Zaelar had taught him, pushed—

Nothing. The air scattered like smoke.

The attacker recovered. Blade rising.

Third try. Desperate. Drusniel threw everything he had into a single compressed burst, felt something tear behind his eyes—

The attacker stumbled back. Just a step. Just enough.

Warmth trickled from Drusniel's nose. Blood. He'd pushed too hard, the way Zaelar had warned him not to.

He didn't care.

Drusniel ran.

The corridor was chaos. Smoke everywhere, thick and choking. The bioluminescent lights were dead, sabotaged. Somewhere below, steel rang against steel.

"Mother! Father!"

His voice echoed in the darkness. No response.

He ran toward the main stairs. His bare feet slapped against stone. His lungs burned with smoke.

A servant's body lay crumpled at the junction. Eyes open. Throat cut.

*Run, young master. Run.*

The words the servant had never gotten to say.

Drusniel kept moving. The stairs were ahead—and beyond them, his parents' quarters, the family wing, everyone he loved—

"Drusniel!"

Shyntara. Her voice cut through the chaos, somewhere to his left.

He turned. Tried to orient. The smoke made it impossible to see more than a few feet.

"This way!" Her hand found his arm, gripped hard. "The escape route. Mother's already—"

A scream. High and terrible. Cut short.

They both froze.

"Mother," Drusniel whispered.

"We can't help her." Shyntara's voice was steel. "The passage. Now."

"I'm not leaving—"

"She's dead." The words hit like physical blows. "Father's holding the main corridor. He ordered me to get you out."

"No. No, I can—"

Steel clashed somewhere close. Shouts. Their father's voice, roaring something Drusniel couldn't make out.

Then silence.

Shyntara's grip tightened. "Move. Now."

She pulled him forward. Through the smoke. Past the bodies. Away from the sounds of dying.

Drusniel's mind fragmented. This wasn't real. Couldn't be real. His family—his parents—the dinner just hours ago—

The escape passage appeared ahead. A hidden door, barely visible even to those who knew it existed.

Shyntara shoved him toward it. "Go. I'll follow."

"Shyn—"

"GO."

She turned back toward the chaos. Toward the attackers. Toward the screams.

Drusniel hesitated one instant too long.

The ceiling collapsed.

Stone and timber crashed down between them. Dust and smoke billowed. Drusniel threw his arms up, felt debris slam into his shoulder, his back—

When he looked up, the corridor was blocked.

"Shyntara!"

No response. Just the crackle of flames and the distant clash of combat.

He was alone.

The escape passage waited behind him. Dark. Empty. A path to survival.

And somewhere beyond the rubble, his sister was fighting. Maybe dying. Definitely gone.

Drusniel stood in the darkness, covered in dust and blood that might be his own, and felt the world he'd known collapse into ruins around him.

He ran.

Not toward the passage. Not toward safety.

Toward his parents' screams.
