1. filename: separation-platform.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Standing frozen, face blank with shock, arms hanging loose. Alone on a wide obsidian trial platform as other candidates stream past in both directions. Vast underground trial chamber with a polished obsidian platform at center, successful candidates filing toward a carved dark-wood door on one side, failed candidates shuffling toward a dim corridor on the other. Clusters of bioluminescent fungi mounted in the cavern ceiling casting purple-blue light straight down, photons reflecting off the mirror-polished obsidian floor creating distorted inverted silhouettes of every figure, the conchoidal fracture surfaces of the stone producing sharp specular highlights. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Obsidian platform: volcanic glass, mirror-polish finish, high refractive index producing near-perfect floor reflections. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: annariel-look-back.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Annariel looked back once.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Annariel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Eyes wide and desperate, mouth forming inaudible words, looking over his shoulder. Being pulled forward by a mage's grip on his shoulder. Other successful candidates visible as blurred shapes beyond the dark carved doorway. Torchlight from inside the doorway casting warm amber-spectrum photons from behind Annariel, backlighting the edges of his hair with a rim of warm light while his face receives cooler bioluminescent illumination from the platform, creating a warm-to-cool gradient across his cheekbones and the bridge of his nose. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: shame-hall.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Names covered every surface.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . A small silhouette walking alone down a narrow obsidian corridor. Thousands of names carved deep into the black stone walls from floor to ceiling, some worn smooth by centuries, others freshly cut. Sparse bioluminescent fungi spaced far apart along the ceiling casting isolated pools of dim blue-green light, each pool illuminating a section of carved names while the gaps between remain in near-darkness, the carved letter grooves creating micro-shadows within each name that deepen with age as edges erode. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Carved obsidian: volcanic glass with incised lettering, older carvings showing erosion-smoothed edges, newer cuts exposing fresh conchoidal fracture surfaces with higher reflectivity. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-clerk.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The clerk wrote something down.")
prompt: A grey-robed drow clerk seated behind a heavy stone desk, not looking up. Quill moving across a leather-bound ledger. Stacks of ledgers piled on either side. Face slack with practiced indifference. Small utilitarian chamber at the end of a corridor, bare stone. A single oil lamp on the desk casting a warm cone of 2200K light downward onto the ledger and the clerk's writing hand, the warm photons attenuating sharply beyond the desk edge leaving the upper face in shadow, obsidian walls absorbing incident light with only faint specular reflections of the flame visible in the polished surfaces. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, not perfectly exposed. Oil lamp: burning wick in rendered animal fat, warm-spectrum thermal emission with visible flicker. Leather ledger: tanned hide cover, ink-saturated parchment pages. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: waiting-bench.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel sat on a cold stone bench.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Sitting on a stone bench, elbows on knees, staring at the floor. To his left, a young drow girl with face buried in hands. To his right, a boy staring at his own palms. An older drow at the far end with hollow eyes. None looking at each other. Low-ceilinged waiting chamber, bare stone walls. Overhead bioluminescent fungi casting flat even blue-grey light straight down onto the bench occupants, no warmth in the spectrum, each figure casting a faint shadow directly beneath them on the stone floor, the cold light reflecting off the polished bench surface and bouncing upward under their chins. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Stone bench: quarried granite, cold thermal mass, polished sitting surface with rough-hewn legs. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
