1. filename: separation-platform.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Standing frozen, face blank with shock, arms hanging loose at his sides. Alone on a wide obsidian trial platform as other candidates stream past in both directions. Successful candidates filing toward a carved dark-wood door on the left, failed candidates shuffling toward a dim corridor on the right. The platform lit from above by clusters of bioluminescent fungi mounted in the cavern ceiling, purple-blue light falling straight down and pooling on the polished obsidian floor, reflecting distorted silhouettes. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: annariel-look-back.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Annariel looked back once.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Looking over his shoulder, eyes wide and desperate, mouth forming words that cannot be heard. Being pulled forward by a mage's grip on his shoulder. Other successful candidates visible as blurred shapes filing through the dark carved doorway beyond him. Torchlight from inside the doorway casting warm amber from behind Annariel, illuminating the edges of his hair and shoulder while his face remains lit by the cooler bioluminescent glow from the platform behind him. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shame-hall.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Names covered every surface.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, A small silhouette walking alone down a narrow obsidian corridor. Thousands of names carved deep into the black stone walls from floor to ceiling, some worn smooth by centuries, others freshly cut. The corridor narrowing into darkness ahead. Sparse bioluminescent fungi spaced far apart along the ceiling casting isolated pools of dim blue-green light, each pool illuminating a section of carved names while the gaps between remain in near-total darkness. Canon EOS R5 16mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: the-clerk.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "The clerk wrote something down.")
prompt:A grey-robed drow clerk seated behind a heavy stone desk, not looking up from a leather-bound ledger. Quill moving across the page. Stacks of similar ledgers piled on either side. Face slack with practiced indifference. A small chamber at the end of the shame hall, utilitarian, bare stone. A single oil lamp on the desk casting a warm cone of light downward onto the ledger and the clerk's writing hand, leaving the upper face in shadow, the obsidian walls absorbing most of the light. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: waiting-bench.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel sat on a cold stone bench.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Sitting on a stone bench, elbows on knees, staring at the floor. To his left, a young drow girl with her face buried in her hands. To his right, a boy staring at his own palms. An older drow at the far end with hollow eyes. None of them looking at each other. A low-ceilinged waiting chamber, bare stone walls, cold and featureless. Overhead bioluminescent fungi casting flat, even, unflattering blue-grey light downward onto the bench occupants, no warmth in the light, each figure casting a faint shadow directly beneath them. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
