## Chapter 5.1 | The Gathering Storm

---

"Family meeting. Now. All of you."

Drusniel had never heard his father use that tone. In eighteen years of living under the same roof, his father's voice had been many things—cold, dismissive, occasionally proud—but never urgent. Never afraid.

He found his way to the study where his parents waited, Shyntara already there, standing with her arms folded and her face carefully blank. The room smelled of old paper and weapon oil.

Their father stood behind his desk, hands flat on the scarred wood. The posture he used when delivering serious news. But this time, something else lived behind his eyes. Something that made Drusniel's stomach tighten.

"House Vrinn has crossed lines."

The name landed like a stone in still water. Drusniel had heard it before—whispered in corridors, mentioned in his father's conversations with other house leaders—but never spoken directly in a family meeting. Never with this weight.

"Territorial moves," his father continued. "Insults at the market council. Challenges to our trade agreements. They're testing us."

"This is different from the usual posturing." Their mother spoke from her chair by the window, her voice measured. "The pattern has changed. They're not negotiating anymore. They're preparing."

Shyntara uncrossed her arms. "Their assassins have been seen near our borders. Three times this week. Different entry points each time. They're mapping our patrol routes."

"You're certain?" their father asked.

"I tracked the last one myself. Vrinn markers on his equipment. They're not even bothering to hide it anymore."

Drusniel's thumb tapped against his fingers. Seven, eight, nine. The counting helped him process what he was hearing.

*The voice warned me about this,* he thought. *Something about House Vrinn planning moves. Uncomfortably close to what's happening now.*

"What are we going to do?" Drusniel asked.

His father's attention shifted to him. For a moment, something like surprise flickered across his features—as if he'd expected Drusniel to stay silent.

"We're doubling patrols. Checking all wards. Moving valuables to the secure vault." He paused. "And we're sending word to our allies. If this escalates, we'll need support."

"Why now?" Drusniel pressed. "What changed?"

"Ambition." His father's jaw tightened. "House Vrinn has been building strength for years. Acquiring territory. Making deals. They see us as an obstacle to their expansion. We've resisted their pressure for too long."

"We're a target," Shyntara said flatly. "Because we're in their way."

"We're a target because we're valuable." Their father met each of their gazes in turn. "Our trade routes. Our connections. Our position in the council. If they break us, they inherit everything we've built."

"There's history," their mother added quietly. "Between our houses. Before either of you were born."

"Ancient history," their father said, but his jaw tightened.

"Tell them." Their mother's voice was soft but firm. "They need to understand what we're facing."

A long silence. Then their father sighed.

"Vrinn and Thel'varin have been rivals for four generations. Land disputes. Trade conflicts. Marriage negotiations that went... poorly." He ran a hand across his face. "Their current patriarch, Korenth, believes we stole his birthright. A mining claim that should have passed to his grandmother. The council ruled in our favor. He never forgave it."

"He's been building toward this for decades," their mother said. "Patient. Methodical. Waiting for the right moment to strike."

"And now he's found it," Shyntara finished. "Our informants are dead. Our allies are distracted by their own problems. We're isolated."

"Not isolated." Their father's voice hardened. "We still have our walls. Our guards. Our training." His gaze moved to each of them. "We still have each other."

Silence settled over the room. Drusniel felt the weight of it—the generations of work, the carefully constructed alliances, the family name that meant something in Umbra'kor's politics.

All of it threatened by a single ambitious house. A grudge older than Drusniel's entire life.

"Stay close to home." His father's voice hardened. "All of you. No unnecessary trips. No solo excursions. Something is coming, and I want this family together when it arrives."

Drusniel thought of Zaelar's tower. The training that happened every day on the surface. The power that was finally filling the void in his chest.

He said nothing.

"Understood?" his father pressed.

"Understood," Shyntara said.

"Understood," Drusniel echoed.

Their father nodded. "Good. Now go. Prepare however you need to prepare. But stay alert. All of you."

The meeting ended. Drusniel retreated to his room, mind churning.

*House Vrinn.* The enemy had a name now. A shape. A direction for the anger that had been building since the trial, since the manipulation, since everything had started going wrong.

If Vrinn threatened his family—if they made good on whatever they were planning—

He clenched his fist. The air in the room stirred, responding to his emotion before he could control it.

*Power is the answer to enemies.*

Zaelar's words. True words, whatever else was true about the old mage.

Drusniel would continue training. He would grow stronger. And when the time came to protect his family—

He would be ready.
