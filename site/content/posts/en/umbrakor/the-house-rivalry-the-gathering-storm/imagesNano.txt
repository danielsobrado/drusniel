1. filename: family-meeting.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father, Mother, Shyntara, Drusniel]. Father urgent authority under strain, hands flat on the scarred desk; Mother measured focus seated by the window; Shyntara arms folded, face carefully blank; Drusniel anxious concentration, thumb tapping against fingers. Cramped study smelling of old paper and weapon oil, maps and ledgers spread on the desk, shelves of rolled parchment and oiled blades behind, dust motes suspended in still air. Warm oil-lamp on the desk is the key light, amber flicker pooling across paper fibers and scarred wood; cool blue-green street-glow from the window adds a thin rim along cheekbones and page edges, reflections skating on oiled metal and lacquered leather while corners fall to near-black. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: vrinn-house-sigil.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "House Vrinn has crossed lines.")
prompt:Macro close-up on a House Vrinn signet ring pressed into black wax on a folded letter, spider-like crest stamped deep; parchment on scarred desk beside a smear of weapon oil and grit. Desk oil-lamp is the only light source; amber flicker reveals wax micro-cracks and paper grain, hard specular highlights pop on worn metal edges, and shadows fall to near-black beyond the letter. Sony A7R V 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight dust on lens, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: map-patrols.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "They're mapping our patrol routes.")
prompt:Top-down close-up of a hand-drawn map of Umbra’kor tunnel routes on scarred wood, weighted by a dagger and small stones; red chalk marks and pin-pricks ring the Thel’varin border points, tiny Vrinn marker tokens laid out as proof. Warm lamp light rakes across paper fibers and chalk dust, casting hard pin shadows; cool window spill adds blue-green edge highlights on dagger spine and marker rims, reflections sliding across oiled leather straps nearby. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: history-grudge.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "He never forgave it.")
prompt:Flashback tableau in a dim council chamber: two rival house leaders across a stone table with an old mining claim map unrolled, one hand clenched in silent fury while the other rests on a sealed council decree; surrounding figures watch like statues, no legible writing on documents. Violet bioluminescent sconces and a single torch provide mixed diegetic light; cold violet edge highlights trace cheekbones and table corners, warm orange flicker crawls across parchment and stone, shadows pool ink-black behind and under the table lip. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation around the torch flame, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: drusniel-clenched-fist.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "He clenched his fist.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Anger locked down into control, jaw tight, eyes fixed on his own hand; clenched fist in the foreground as dust motes and loose fabric threads lift and spiral around knuckles, face in soft blur behind. Single candle and low oil-lamp are the only light sources; warm flicker turns dust into tiny amber points, highlights skate across skin pores and candle wax, and the rest of the room sinks into heavy shadow with only faint reflected glow on wood grain. Sony A7R V 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
