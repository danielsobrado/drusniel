## Chapter 7 | Part 9

--- 

The map covered Zaelar's entire desk.

Drusniel had never seen anything like it—not a map of tunnels or caverns, but of the surface world, stretching across distances he couldn't comprehend. Coastlines. Mountains. Forests. And at the eastern edge, beyond a stretch of water marked with warning symbols, a landmass labeled in faded ink.

"Wyrmreach," Zaelar said, tracing the coastline with one long finger. "The land beyond the barrier."

"I know what Wyrmreach is." Drusniel kept his distance from the desk. "Every drow child learns the stories. The nightmare sea. The barrier. The realm of dragons. No one who crosses returns."

"No *ordinary* drow returns." Zaelar looked up. "But you're not ordinary, are you?"

The compliment landed differently than it once had. After the letter, after the questions, Drusniel had learned to hear the shape of manipulation even when the words sounded true.

"Why are you showing me this?"

"Because I need a courier." Zaelar straightened, hands folded behind his back. "Someone who can survive the crossing. The nightmare sea kills anyone without strong elemental affinity. Air and water both. The combination that makes you rare is also the combination that makes passage possible."

"You want me to go to Wyrmreach."

"I want you to consider it." Zaelar moved to the window, looking out at gray sky. "There are things I need delivered. Items that would be dangerous to transport any other way. In exchange..."

"In exchange?"

"A place where drow with your gifts are respected. Valued. Not feared or rejected." He turned back. "The lords of Wyrmreach understand elemental magic. They prize it. You wouldn't be a failed candidate there. You'd be something rare and precious."

The words tugged at something in Drusniel's chest. The same place that ached when his father looked through him. The same place that burned when the mages had dismissed him as another disappointment.

"I won't leave my family."

"Your family." Zaelar's expression didn't change, but something in his voice shifted. "The family that doesn't know where you go each day. The family whose enemies circle closer every week."

Drusniel's stomach tightened. "What do you mean?"

"House politics. Old rivalries. The usual drow games." A dismissive wave. "I hear rumors. Patterns that suggest your family's enemies have been positioning themselves. The signals are... concerning, if the pattern holds."

"What signals?"

"Movement near contested territory. Unusual activity among houses historically aligned against yours. It could be nothing." He met Drusniel's gaze. "But the shape of it suggests escalation. You've seen the signs yourself. Your father's tension. The increased patrols. The fear that no one speaks aloud."

Drusniel thought of the family meeting. His father's controlled panic. Shyntara's sharp questions about his absences.

"You're saying my family is in danger."

"I'm saying that choices will need to be made soon. By you. By them." Zaelar's voice softened. "Wyrmreach is not a death sentence, Drusniel. It's an opportunity. A place where you could grow strong enough to protect the people you love." A pause. "Or avenge them, if it comes to that."

*Avenge.*

The word hung in the air. Heavy. Terrible.

"What would I be delivering?"

"Does it matter?"

"It might."

Zaelar considered him for a long moment. "An artifact. Something needed by those who would ally with your interests. Something that would establish your value and guarantee your protection." He set the rolled map aside. "Nothing that would compromise your principles. Simply a tool."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you refuse." He spread his hands. "I won't force you, Drusniel. The choice must be yours. But understand—your family's safety might depend on choices you make soon. I would hate to see you look back and wonder if a different decision might have changed things."

The threat was veiled. Gentle. Almost kind.

That made it worse.

"I need time," Drusniel said.

"Of course." Zaelar's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Take all the time you need. But remember—time is the one resource none of us have as much of as we think."

He paused at the doorway, then turned back. "Should you decide to go—when you reach the shore of the nightmare sea, there's a cove. Three hundred paces north of where the barrier meets the coast. Look for the black rocks shaped like broken teeth." His voice became matter-of-fact, instructional. "Behind them, hidden in the cave beneath, there's a boat. Small. Reinforced hull. It won't make the crossing easy, but it will make it possible."

"You left a boat there?"

"I've had it maintained for years. Waiting." Zaelar's expression didn't change. "The nightmare sea can be crossed by swimming, if your affinities are strong enough. But strong enough to survive doesn't mean strong enough to arrive functional. The boat gives you options. A platform to work from. A way to pace yourself."

"And I just... take it?"

"It's there because I put it there. It will be there whether you use it or not." He gestured to the map. "The crossing will test you regardless. Water magic to navigate the currents. Air magic to keep breathing when the sea tries to fill your lungs. The boat doesn't eliminate the danger—it gives you a chance to control it instead of being controlled by it."

Drusniel looked at the map, at the stretch of water between Astalor and Wyrmreach marked with warning symbols.

"Why tell me this now? Before I've decided?"

"Because preparation isn't commitment." Zaelar moved back to his desk. "And because if you go, I want you to arrive. Dead couriers deliver nothing."
