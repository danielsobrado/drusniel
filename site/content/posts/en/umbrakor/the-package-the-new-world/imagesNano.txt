1. filename: wyrmreach-landscape.jpg
role: header
prompt:Photorealistic wide establishing shot of Wyrmreach: black rock like it was burned yesterday, darker soil between jagged outcrops, and a vast empty shore under a sky that presses down with diffuse rust-red glow. Strange vegetation pulses faintly in the distance, casting wrong-tinted shadows that jitter against basalt, while the air looks hot and heavy with haze. The red ambient is the main light source, flat and sunless; intermittent pulses from the plants add thin highlights that crawl along wet stone edges and pick out grit texture. Sony A7R V 16mm f/1.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, mild barrel distortion, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: drusniel-wet.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Water streaming from his clothes.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: exhausted and stunned, breath working hard in heavy air; water streaming from hair and clothes. Drusniel kneels on warm black rock at the shoreline, one hand braced as he forces himself upright, eyes scanning an empty horizon while provisions and pack straps cling wet. Diffuse rust-red sky glow tints everything flat; wet fabric and skin catch sharp specular sheen, interactive reflections flickering in tiny droplets along seams and knuckles. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight water droplets on lens, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: strange-plants.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Plants that pulsed faintly.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up on strange Wyrmreach vegetation: thick fibrous stalks and waxy leaves beaded with moisture, internal luminescence pulsing faintly beneath the surface like a slow heartbeat. The plant glow provides cool colored highlights that spill onto nearby grit and stone; diffuse red sky glow fills everything else flat and oppressive, interactive sheen catching on wet membranes and dust grains. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the bioluminescence. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: giant-eye-mountain.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "One of the mountains moved.")
prompt:Photorealistic extreme long shot of the horizon where a mountain-like silhouette shifts and resettles, revealing the truth in a slow impossible movement: one "peak" is a colossal shoulder and a single eye catches the red haze for an instant. Foreground is empty black rock and sparse pulsing plants for scale. Diffuse rust-red ambient and atmospheric haze flatten distance; the eye glint provides a single hard point of brightness, then vanishes, with heat-haze shimmer distorting the edges. Sony A7R V 200mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: hiding-fear.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel ducked behind an outcropping.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: terror contained into stillness, hands shaking as he forces quiet; eyes locked on a thin fissure in the rock. Drusniel presses flat behind a jagged outcropping, trying to cover the protective pouch in his pack as the artifact inside pulses stronger, blue light leaking between fingers and stitching. Flat rust-red ambient fights with the cool blue pulse, interactive color contrast sliding over knuckles and wet fabric while deep shadows swallow everything beyond the hiding place. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the blue pulse, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
