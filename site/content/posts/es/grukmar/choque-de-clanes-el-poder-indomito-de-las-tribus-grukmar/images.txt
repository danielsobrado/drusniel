1. filename: morrigan-studies-zikvik.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Morrigan] Expression: cold appraisal; posture still; one hand resting near her belt, ready. Captain Morrigan stands an arm's length from rusted iron bars in a border-post holding cell while Zikvik presses his face to the metal, grinning with broken teeth; three fingers missing, ear torn; a leather pouch spills non-goblin teeth beside a crude map scratched onto stained hide on the damp stone floor. A single iron lantern overhead burns with a cold blue-white oil flame, throwing barred shadows across Morrigan and the goblin; rust catches dull warm glints at the edges where the flame flickers. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the lantern. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: zikvik-grins-at-bars.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El goblin presionó su cara contra los barrotes, sonriendo con lo que quedaba de sus dientes.")
prompt:Tight portrait through iron bars: Zikvik's face mashed forward in a manic grin, yellow eyes bright with fear and calculation; scars and grime packed into the creases; torn ear ragged; his remaining fingers clamp the bars and leave rust stains on his palm. Cold lantern light rakes across his face at a harsh side angle, carving deep shadows into every scar and catching moisture as tiny specular points on lips and skin. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: sealed-intel-report.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Morrigan archivó su informe esa noche.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Morrigan] Focused, unsmiling; eyes slightly bloodshot with fatigue; quill hand steady. Late-night desk in the border post command office: she writes an intelligence report with dense handwriting (not readable) while a brass wax seal warms near a beeswax candle, patrol reports lie tied with cord, and the goblin's tooth pouch sits open in an evidence tray at the edge of the desk. An oil lamp provides warm amber light that pools on parchment and leather, falling off fast into black stone corners; the candle adds a second, smaller glow that catches the wax seal as it softens. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: zikvik-runs-for-treeline.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "No miró hacia atrás.")
prompt:Zikvik runs hard toward a dark treeline of gnarled swamp oaks, bare feet slapping wet earth and mud kicking up behind; his missing fingers flash in silhouette as his arms pump. Behind him, the border palisade recedes into ground fog and stake shadows; ahead, the trees are a black mass with gaps like mouths. Low dusk light from the horizon backlights him in warm amber, catching edge highlights on shoulders and ears while fog diffuses the light into a soft gradient at knee height. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the feet. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: oversized-tracks-into-swamp.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Hasta ahora, nada había emergido. Pero los exploradores seguían encontrando esas huellas—siempre alejándose del interior, siempre frescas, siempre demasiado grandes para explicar.")
prompt:Three border soldiers stand at the edge of a Grukmar swamp, staring down at massive footprints pressed deep into black mud, wet edges still slumping; the tracks lead outward toward the border with a stride too wide to make sense. Reed beds and dark water hem the track line; insects hang above the surface; a smear of distant smoke stains the grey horizon. Flat overcast daylight makes the mud read like dark mirrors; a hand lantern adds a low warm accent that catches the nearest reeds and throws small orange reflections across pooled water in the prints. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, deep depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
