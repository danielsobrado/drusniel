1. filename: fortress-gate-stockade.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: exhausted shock, wrists bound in rope. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: tight fear, stumbling under the shove. Varian and Elric are marched toward the gate of a crude goblin-and-orc stockade in a barren ravine, sharpened log palisade and watchtowers looming as goblins jab them forward with spear shafts, smoke and ash drifting in cold twilight and a decadent interior glow hinting at a ruler within. Torch baskets on the palisade provide the only warm light, flickering orange through smoke and catching wet eyeshine, rope fibers, and ash in the air while the twilight stays cold and grey. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: spear-at-the-eye.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "La punta de una lanza atravesó la red y se detuvo a un centímetro de su ojo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: waking panic held perfectly still, eyes locked on the spear tip. Varian lies tangled in a coarse rope net on hard dirt as a ring of goblins crowds close with wet eyeshine and jagged teeth, a spear point punching through and stopping an inch from his eye, breath vapor and grime visible in the smoke. Harsh torchlight cuts through the haze, warm and directional, throwing hard shadows across netting and lighting the spear tip with a sharp specular glint. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: blindfolded-through-corridors.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Varian vislumbraba con cada giro —jaulas repletas de prisioneros tan demacrados que apenas parecían humanos, losas de ofrenda oscurecidas con sangre vieja, piras crepitando con llamas verdes.")
prompt:A blindfolded prisoner is dragged through a rough corridor inside the fort, cloth gag smeared with dirt and hands yanked forward by unseen guards, iron cages packed with gaunt captives lining the walls, offering slabs dark with old blood, and a brazier crackling with eerie green flame. The green flame is the primary light, casting sickly highlights on wet stone, iron bars, and smeared cloth while the rest of the corridor falls to torchlit shadow and smoke. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, slightly underexposed, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: korgath-on-throne.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Cuando sonrió, Varian notó que le habían limado los dientes hasta dejarlos en punta.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Korgath] Expression: cultured amusement, smile flashing filed teeth; rings catching light. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: tense disbelief, dirt-streaked. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: ash-pale dread, eyes fixed on Korgath. A lavish chamber of plush rugs and gilded furniture sits amid surrounding filth as Korgath reclines on an ornate throne, Varian and Elric held in the foreground by guards, smoke and stench heavy in the air. Torchlight is the only light, warm and flickering, glinting off jewelry and gilded edges while leaving the corners of the chamber in deep shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: proposition-in-torchlight.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Korgath se inclinó hacia delante.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Korgath] Expression: calm predatory curiosity, leaning forward. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: resolve cracking, sweat beading, wrists bound. Korgath leans close from the throne as a hooded druid waits in shadow holding a small cup, torture tools half-seen on a side table, Varian forced to listen in the low heat and smoke of the room. One torch sconce provides low warm light from the side, carving cheekbones and casting long shadows across rope and metal tools while a distant green brazier tint bleeds faintly into the darkness. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
