1. filename: group-leaves-riverhold.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Eldric, Xandor, Maris, Balin] Photorealistic, dawn departure; five travelers gather in the inn courtyard with packs loaded and weapons checked, faces set with different kinds of determination as the day starts too early. Dulint shoulders the heaviest pack, Eldric scans the perimeter in old military kit, Xandor guards a special carrier strapped to his gear, Maris stands pale but steady, and Balin can't hide restless energy. Pale sunrise washes the stone courtyard in cool light and long shadows, while a faint warm spill from a dying hearth or lantern gives subtle amber fill on leather and metal edges. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: xandor-plants-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Xandor tenía sus plantas aseguradas en un transportador especial")
prompt:Photorealistic travel detail; close view of a specialized leather carrier strapped to a pack, fitted with small glass vials and boxed cuttings wrapped in damp cloth, carefully lashed so nothing clinks or breaks while walking. Fingers adjust a buckle and check the padding, showing the care of someone protecting living companions rather than tools. Morning light glints on glass and wet leaves, creating tiny specular highlights and soft reflections, while the background falls into blurred courtyard stone and moving legs. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: beacon-warmth.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El Faro pulsaba en la mochila de Dulint")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, weight you can feel; Dulint adjusts a shoulder strap as the Beacon's warmth presses through the pack against his back, eyes tightening for a moment as if the pulse is a bruise. Canvas is pulled tight over a hard internal shape, straps creak under the load, and a faint heat shimmer rises off the cloth while a cold-blue pulse barely leaks through seams like a heartbeat. Cool morning daylight reveals fabric weave and dirt scuffs, while the Beacon's internal pulse adds brief icy highlights that appear and vanish along stitching and metal buckles. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in fingertips, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-steady.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris se veía pálida pero firme")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, pale but steady; she stands in the courtyard with travel dirt on her clothes, posture controlled despite exhaustion, eyes forward as if refusing to show what the Beacon is doing to her. The group moves around her in soft blur, packs shifting and buckles clicking as final checks happen. Cool dawn light flattens color and emphasizes fatigue, while a small warm lantern or hearth glow adds faint amber reflections on the underside of her jaw and the edges of her hands. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: dulint-final-look-back.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Dulint miró atrás una vez mientras los muros de Riverhold se encogían")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, regret held in check; Dulint turns his head back mid-step, eyes narrowed with duty and fear, as Riverhold's wallline and roofs blur behind him in the mist, already shrinking with distance. The strap on his shoulder bites and his jaw flexes as if swallowing words he cannot share. Low morning sun sits behind and slightly to the side, creating a warm rim around his profile and a soft flare that blooms at the edge of frame, while cool sky fill keeps skin and gear grounded and real. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
