1. filename: captains-map.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: flinty focus, jaw working; finger tracing a ridgeline. [Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: stiff discipline, voice low and controlled. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: urgent seriousness, sketch held forward. Candlelit captain's quarters with damp wood walls and stale wax, desk buried in overlapping maps with peeling corners. Candle stubs are the only light, warm and close; amber pools on parchment, highlights catch knuckle ridges and wax sheen, shadows fall hard across timber walls with deep falloff into corners. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: mist-patrol.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "La niebla se enroscaba entre troncos erosionados")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: building tension, eyes scanning the shrouds. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: wary focus, spear held tight. Misty forest patrol on an old game trail, fog curling between eroded trunks and swallowing sound, two younger guards following with white knuckles on spears. Pale sunrise filtered through fog provides diffuse cool light; fog scatters light into soft fill, wet leaves and loam catch faint silver highlights, moisture beads reflect as tiny points along ferns. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: fresh-tracks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las huellas estaban ahí.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: frozen focus, finger pointing toward the loam. [Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: controlled alarm, crouched close. Macro close ground-level detail in grey clay under ferns, fresh clawed footprints deep and splayed with water seeping into depressions, breath faint in cold mist. Diffuse mist light is the only illumination, cold and even; grazing light creates tiny specular points on wet clay ridges while the center pools darker as water collects, background soft and unfocused. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Ektar 100, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: outpost-return.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El puesto se alzaba adelante")
prompt:Dusk return to the outpost, view from the gate as the patrol emerges from fog like silhouettes, palisade timbers and iron hardware wet with evening damp, torchlight flaring against the grey treeline. Dusk and torch baskets provide the only light; cold sky backlight silhouettes the outpost while warm torchlight throws orange highlights on palisade faces, smoke catching halation and softening the far background to grey. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: yard-report.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric esperaba en el patio iluminado por antorchas.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: worry held behind command, gaze distant. [Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: exhaustion under discipline. Varian reports in the muddy yard as guards gather around cookfires and torches, smoke drifting low and boots tracking filth across the ground, palisade looming behind. Firelight is the primary light, warm and flickering; orange highlights move across faces and wet mud, reflections shimmer on damp cloth, and the forest beyond the wall stays absolute black. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
