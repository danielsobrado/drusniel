1. filename: captains-map.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: flinty focus, jaw working; finger tracing a ridgeline. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: stiff discipline, voice low and controlled. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: urgent seriousness, sketch held forward. Candlelit captain's quarters with damp wood walls and stale wax, Eldric leaning over a desk buried in overlapping maps with peeling corners while Varian stands at attention and Elric presents a charcoal sketch beside him. Candle stubs are the only light, warm and close, pooling on parchment and hands, throwing hard shadows across timber walls and leaving far corners in gloom. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: mist-patrol.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "La niebla se enroscaba entre troncos erosionados")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: building tension, eyes scanning the shrouds. [Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: wary focus, spear held tight. Misty forest patrol on an old game trail, fog curling between eroded trunks and swallowing sound, Hal and Leofric following close behind with white knuckles on spears as the path vanishes into grey. Pale reluctant sunrise filtered through fog provides diffuse cool light, softening edges while wet leaves and loam catch faint silver highlights at ground level. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: fresh-tracks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las huellas estaban ahí.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elric] Expression: frozen focus, finger pointing toward the loam. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: controlled alarm, crouched close. Fresh clawed footprints press deep into grey clay under ferns, edges still slick as water seeps into the depressions while breath hangs faint in cold mist and crushed plants frame the mark. Diffuse mist light is the only illumination, cold and even, grazing wet clay to create small specular points while the surrounding ground falls to soft shadow. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: outpost-return.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El puesto se alzaba adelante")
prompt:Dusk return to the outpost, view from the gate as the patrol emerges from fog like dark silhouettes, palisade timbers and iron hardware wet with evening damp, torchlight flaring against the grey treeline as the sky bleeds into twilight. Dusk and torch baskets provide the only light, cold fading sky behind and flickering warm orange on the palisade faces, smoke catching halation and softening the background. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: yard-report.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric esperaba en el patio iluminado por antorchas.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: worry held behind command, gaze distant. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: exhaustion under discipline, shoulders tight. Torchlit yard inside the palisade, Eldric waiting as Varian gives a tired report, guards gathered around cookfires with smoke drifting low and boots tracking filth across wet ground. Firelight and torches are the primary light, warm and flickering, throwing moving shadows across faces and mud while the dark beyond the wall swallows detail. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
