## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Torch flames gutter in the damp air and throw restless shadows across the yard. Soldiers shift around the cookfires, boots squelching in mud.
[00:03-00:05] Varian finishes the report and swallows hard, shoulders tightening as he waits for a reaction. Eldric's stare stays distant for a beat too long, as if measuring something beyond the words.
[00:05-00:08] Eldric turns his head toward the treeline beyond the palisade, listening. The fire pops and briefly flares brighter, then settles, leaving the yard in uneasy hush.

Slow dolly-in from Varian to Eldric.
Audio: torch crackle, low fire pop, muddy footsteps, armor and spear-haft creaks, distant wind through trees, quiet breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
