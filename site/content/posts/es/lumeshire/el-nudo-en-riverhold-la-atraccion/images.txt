1. filename: tense-waiting.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, coiled readiness; hand hovering near the knife at his belt, gaze never settling. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Tight concentration, hand hovering over the cube without touching. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Sharp alertness replacing fidgeting, eyes fixed on the street below. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Calm strained thin, moving between them like a mediator with no words left. After hours of waiting in the cramped upstairs room, long shadows stretch across worn floorboards and candle stubs gutter low; the Beacon sits on pale silk at the table’s center, still glowing cold blue-white but now radiating heat, making the air feel pressured and close. Flickering candles provide warm amber pools that barely hold back the dark, while the Beacon’s cold glow adds icy fill that makes faces look more haunted than tired. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, halation around the blue glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: artifact-heat.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Ahora está irradiando calor.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, wary concentration; brows tight, breath held as he tests the air without touching. Dulint holds his hand a few inches above the Beacon, and visible heat shimmer warps the air above the dark metal cube; a nearby candle flame bends and flickers in the distortion while the cube stays blue-white and cold-looking even as it radiates warmth. Candlelight and the Beacon’s internal glow mix on the silk cloth, creating warm reflections in the folds and icy edge highlights on the cube’s corners. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-arrival.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Sus ojos estaban desenfocados, distantes")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, exhaustion on the edge of collapse; eyes unfocused and staring past the room, mouth slightly parted as if listening to a sound no one else hears. Maris stands in the threshold with grass caught in her hair and dirt ground into her clothes, swaying as if she walked too far without rest; the cramped room beyond is frozen mid-breath, all eyes on her. Cold hallway light behind her silhouettes her shoulders, while warm candlelight and the Beacon’s faint blue spill catch her face from the front, carving uneasy shadows under her eyes. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: black-water-vision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Una mano deslizándose bajo la superficie.")
prompt:Photorealistic water-level shot of thick black water with an oily sheen moving unnaturally slow, a pale hand breaking the surface and reaching once before slipping under again; small ripples spread and die too quickly, leaving the surface wrong and heavy. Cold moonlight provides the only illumination, turning the water’s skin into dull silver highlights and leaving everything beyond the hand to fall into near-black. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: five-strangers.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Cinco ahora.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, counting and assessing; the veteran’s focus narrowing into leadership by force of habit. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Steady but worn, protective posture near the table. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Impatience redirected into vigilance, eyes darting between faces. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Quiet gravity, watching reactions more than words. [Face_Reference: Maris] Newly arrived and shaken, defensiveness fighting exhaustion. The five of them form a rough, tense circle in the cramped room around the table where the Beacon rests on pale silk, papers and travel gear pushed aside; they look like strangers forced into alignment by something none of them understands. Warm candlelight defines the room’s edges while the Beacon’s cold blue-white glow adds icy fill to faces, making expressions readable but uneasy. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
