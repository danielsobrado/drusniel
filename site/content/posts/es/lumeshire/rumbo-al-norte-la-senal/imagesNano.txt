1. filename: Eldric-halts-group.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. One knee down, fist raised, eyes narrowed. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Pale and listening, pack strap held tight. [Face_Reference: Xandor]. Staff planted, gaze sweeping the trees. [Face_Reference: Maris]. Tense and distant, attention split toward the east. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Mid-whisper, wide-eyed, forced to stop. Eldric halts the group on a dense forest trail, damp moss and snapped twigs underfoot as the birds go abruptly silent and everyone freezes mid-step. Overcast morning light filters through thick branches, soft and cool; green bounce from wet needles tints shadows, and tiny specular highlights sparkle on damp bark and moss where moisture catches the light. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: grukmar-tracks.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Eldric trazó algo con el dedo—un patrón que Balin no podía ver—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Jaw tight in profile, eyes focused on the ground; gloved finger tracing a line. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Leaning in behind him, squinting, unable to see the pattern. Eldric kneels in shadowed moss and traces subtle disturbances in damp earth: pressed needles, snapped twig fibers, faint heavy impressions that look wrong. Diffuse overcast light skims wet moss as tiny silver highlights and rakes across knuckles; dark soil stays matte while moisture creates sharp specular points that flicker as Eldric's hand moves. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-senses-flank.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Moviéndose cuando nos movemos. Deteniéndose cuando nos detenemos.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Eyes half-lidded, head tilted, expression flat with certainty; breath held as if listening. Maris turns toward the dense trees to the east and feels the flank as pressure rather than sound, the underbrush unreadable and still. Muted canopy light stays cool, but a colder cast creeps in from the east as cloud shadow deepens; pale highlights catch the wet edges of leaves and reflect as tiny points near her cheekbones while the background falls into dark blur. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: dulint-artifact-burden.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Esa cosa no dejará de transmitir nuestra posición.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Dread in the eyes, shoulders sagging under the strap; hand tightening as he shifts the pack. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Guarded readiness in the background, hand near sword. Dulint adjusts the heavy pack that never leaves him, aware the artifact inside keeps broadcasting their position; a faint cold-blue pulse leaks through seam stitching onto cloak fibers like a bruise of light. Soft gray-green overcast light fills the forest, but the blue pulse adds hard edge-light on strap and knuckles and bounces as a thin blue reflection on wet leaves. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: balin-looks-back.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Primera vez siendo presa, pensó.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Fear and realization, eyes wide, breath caught; shoulders twisted as he looks back. Balin glances over his shoulder into woods he can't read, trying to see hunters that never show themselves; tree trunks compress into bars and the trail narrows as the idea of being herded settles in. Late afternoon canopy light turns cool and flat; a faint rim of pale sky catches cheek edges and turns background leaves into a threatening blur with wet highlights flashing as tiny points in motion. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
