1. filename: maris-on-road.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, exhausted and worn down; posture stubbornly upright as she keeps walking through disorientation. Dusty road toward Riverhold in late-day light as she walks alone along wagon ruts and dry dust, worn boots and travel-stained hem visible; farmers pass with empty carts returning from market, a merchant train rattles by with guards giving her casual suspicion, and Riverhold’s gates sit far ahead under a cooling sky. Harsh late sun and dust haze flatten the landscape into warm glare, turning dust into a glowing veil around wheels and boots. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: reality-check-pain.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El dolor funcionaba mejor. Por eso se mordía la lengua.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, anchoring herself to reality: one eye watering from exhaustion, jaw clenched, a small bead of blood at the corner of her lip from biting her tongue. Close portrait with dust clinging to her skin as the road behind blurs, her breath controlled and shaking while she repeats that the pain and the dust are real. Bright sun hits hard on one side of her face, while cooler shadow fill deepens the strain around her eyes. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: riverhold-gate-check.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El guardia gruñó y la dejó pasar.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, tight controlled composure; answering with short words while her hands still tremble. Riverhold gate checkpoint at dusk as Maris steps forward and a tired guard waves her through, the shadow of the stone arch cutting across her face half in light and half in shade; mundane travelers wait in line behind with carts and bundles, pebbled road and worn gate stonework framing the moment. Gate shadow stays cool and heavy, while a strip of late sun cuts across her cheek and the guard's armor, catching dust on fabric and stone. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: riverhold-streets.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La gente se movía con propósito, terminando el trabajo del día antes de que cayera la oscuridad.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, isolated stillness in her tired face as the town moves around her; eyes tracking without fully believing any of it. Riverhold main street as evening work ends: shops line the street with hanging signs (no readable text), an inn window glows warm on a corner, people move with purpose in soft motion blur while Maris walks through the flow. Golden hour warms the street, while deep shadows pool under awnings and doorways; keep her face sharp and the crowd slightly blurred. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the crowd, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-waits-wall.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Así que esperó. Se apoyó contra la pared mientras el sol bajaba más.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, hollow patience and stubborn fear; hands trembling as she waits and listens for the pull to become direction. Solitude beat in a narrow Riverhold street: Maris leans against a cold stone wall as the sun drops and growing shadow swallows her; ordinary life passes blurred in the background while her expression strains under waiting. Setting sun provides a fading warm edge, while twilight shadows deepen under her eyes and along the mortar texture. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
