1. filename: planning-departure.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, practical focus; leaning in with jaw set, one hand flattening the map edge. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Urgent certainty; finger planted on the north route, shoulders tight. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Skeptical watchfulness; eyes angled toward the door, posture ready. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Restless but muted; lips pressed, gaze flicking between Dulint and the Beacon. [Face_Reference: Maris] Exhausted strain; slumped in the corner, eyes unfocused as if listening to a sound no one else hears. The group crowds a scarred table in a dim Riverhold room, an annotated map spread under candle stubs; the Beacon cube pins one corner as its cold pulse spills across parchment fibers and knuckle ridges. Two short candles throw warm amber pools and long shadows across faces and tabletop, while the cube's blue-white internal glow rises from below and paints faint moving geometric reflections that crawl over the map and flicker in wet eyes. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation around the cold glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: xandor-library.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Xandor se levantó, moviéndose hacia una estantería")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, calm urgency; breath controlled, eyes sharp as he reaches for the one scroll he trusts. Xandor stands at a crowded shelf in the back of the room, pulling a dust-stiff map tube and brittle papers from between mismatched books, wax-sealed fragments, and small oddities; soot and paper dust hang in the air. A candle on a nearby crate casts warm amber from below, lighting the undersides of his fingers and throwing a long warped shadow across cracked plaster, while a faint blue-white pulse from the Beacon behind him adds cold edge highlights along scroll seams and catches as tiny specular points in his eyes. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, subtle lens flare, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-exhaustion.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Maris habló desde su esquina, voz cansada.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, hollow exhaustion and pain; dark circles, glassy eyes, mouth barely shaping words as if each sentence costs. Maris sits in a far corner with her back to a cold wall, shoulders slumped, fingers digging into her temple while she speaks about the scream worsening near the Beacon; the table argument blurs beyond her. Candlelight from the table falls off before it reaches her, leaving only a weak warm rim along her cheek, while the Beacon's blue-white pulse washes intermittent cold bands across her face and hands, making shadows jump and tightening the sense of pressure. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, background softly out of focus, slight motion blur from trembling. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: map-to-frostgard.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Los fragmentos apuntan al norte. Hacia Frostgard.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro top-down of the annotated map spread on the scarred table: cramped handwriting too small to read, inked mountain ridges, and a smudged thumbprint where Xandor's finger rests on the northern route toward Frostgard; wax drips and grit are caught in paper fibers. The Beacon cube sits near the corner, its cold blue-white pulse tinting the parchment and turning ink edges slightly metallic, while a nearby candle throws warm amber across the wood grain and makes wax shine in uneven glossy highlights; the two lights mix into cold-warm gradients across map creases. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Macro Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: compass-with-teeth.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El artefacto apuntaba en esa dirección como una brújula con dientes.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, involuntary wince; jaw clenched as if his teeth ache, eyes tracking the shift. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Steady resolve; a brief frown, grip tightening on the map edge. Close shot of the Beacon cube on the table as its internal blue-white pulse intensifies and aligns north, throwing a jagged wedge of light across the parchment like teeth; dust motes shimmer in the beam and paper edges lift slightly. The cube provides hard cold light from low left that carves sharp angular shadows, while a guttering candle behind adds a weak warm rim that catches on wax drips and softens far edges of the scene. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
