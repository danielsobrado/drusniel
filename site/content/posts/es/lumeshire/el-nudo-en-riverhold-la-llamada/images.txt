1. filename: meeting-the-dwarves.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, guarded and measuring; eyes moving room-to-room before they settle on the table. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Bone-tired calm, hands steady despite strain. [Face_Reference: Balin] Restless impatience, weight shifting like he cannot stay seated. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Careful intensity, posture angled away from the object as if respecting a boundary. Eldric stands in the doorway of a cramped room at the Scholar's Rest as Xandor presents the Beacon on a pale silk cloth at the table’s center, its dark metal surface cut with nonlinguistic geometric grooves and one face subtly brighter, oriented toward something unseen; candle stubs and wax drips crowd the edges of the scene, and shadows pool heavier than they should near the corners and window. Flickering candle flames cast warm amber across faces while the Beacon’s cold blue-white internal glow adds a faint, unnatural fill from below, tinting knuckles and jawlines with icy highlights. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, halation around the blue glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: cube-on-silk.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Un cubo. Quizás cuatro pulgadas en cada lado")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of the Beacon: a dark metal cube resting on pale silk, the weave sharply visible where the weight bites into folds. Its surface is unfamiliar alloy with fine geometric channels and inlaid seams (no letters), one face subtly more luminous as if oriented; the glow feels cold, like winter light trapped inside metal. Mixed light from nearby candles plus the Beacon’s internal blue-white glow, creating warm reflections on the silk and icy edge highlights along the cube’s corners. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: balin-impatience.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El enano más joven—Balin, asumió Eldric—hizo un ruido frustrado.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] Photorealistic, frustration breaking through restraint; brows drawn down, jaw tight, one hand mid-gesture as if he cannot stop himself from pointing. Balin rises from his chair beside the window and leans toward the table, demanding answers while the older men stay still; the Beacon glows on silk between them, making his impatience feel louder than the room. Candlelight flicker from a wall sconce to camera-right, with cold blue-white spill from the Beacon lifting the underside of his hands and chin in icy highlights. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, slight motion blur in the gesturing hand, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: xandor-explains.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Las referencias del Nexus, las mecánicas de la barrera")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, intense focus; voice implied in the tension of his mouth, hands hovering close as if mapping an invisible boundary without daring contact. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Watching with clinical attention, still as stone, eyes tracking Xandor’s gestures and the cube’s orientation. Xandor leans over the table and frames the Beacon with his hands above the silk, papers and rough diagrams scattered around the base (any writing indistinct), wax drips frozen on candleholders, the room cramped with the pressure of too many answers and none complete. The Beacon’s cold glow provides uneasy uplight across knuckles and cheekbones, while a candle behind them adds warm rim light that separates faces from the heavy shadows. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare from candle flame, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: counting-exits.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Eldric contó salidas. Tres en esta habitación.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, paranoia made practical; eyes hard, attention split. Over Eldric’s shoulder from just behind the doorway, the room is composed so the exits dominate: the door latch in crisp focus, the window frame and rain-dark street beyond, and the curtained back passage; the table with the Beacon and the others soften into blur as if his mind refuses to stop mapping routes. Warm candlelight pools near the table, but colder window light outlines the window edge and damp sill, pulling the eye toward escape. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
