1. filename: maris-on-fence.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, shoulders slumped from exhaustion; hands trembling on the fence post as the stable vision returns, sweat at her hairline and strain in her eyes. Late afternoon at the edge of an open field under a wind-bruised grey sky as Maris braces herself against rough wood, tall grass bending in gusts and a distant treeline barely visible through haze. Flat cool daylight is the main light source, with brief warm breaks along grass tips when the sun slips through cloud, while the rest stays muted and cold. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: vision-boat-black-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Se mecía en agua que se movía mal")
prompt:Photorealistic stable vision: a small dark wooden boat rocks on black water that moves wrong, too thick and too alive like oil that learned to breathe; the surface swallows light as cold haze clings low and constant starless twilight presses down while vast indistinct shapes drift overhead. Unnatural ambient gloom is the only light, cold and flat, turning the water into black glass with hard highlights along each ripple and wet wood grain. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle halation on highlights. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: vision-hand-reaching.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Piel gris-oscura. Dedos largos.")
prompt:Photorealistic vision detail: a blue-ash skinned hand rises through black water, fingers too long and joints bending subtly wrong, reaching for the boat’s edge just out of frame; the water clings and pulls like heavy syrup, droplets stretching before falling back into the void. A cold pale glow isolates the hand against swallowing black, catching wet skin texture and hard sheen while everything else stays nearly lightless. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: maris-wakes-gasping.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Maris volvió a sí misma con un jadeo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, snapping back with a sharp gasp; eyes wide and unfocused as if the stable image is still looping behind them, one hand crushing the fence post until splinters and wood grain stand out. Close portrait with the empty field blurred behind her, breath shaking and sweat catching at her temple. Late-day sun breaks through cloud and hits one side of her face, while cool shadow fill deepens the panic in her eyes. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-walks-on.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Maris empezó a caminar otra vez.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, hands still trembling but posture turned determined; eyes fixed ahead as if pulled by something in her chest. Three-quarter profile of Maris walking again toward distant Riverhold walls, a straight narrow road cutting through fields and fence lines while wind bends the grass. Evening light cools toward grey, long shadows stretching across ruts and stubble as the horizon darkens. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in her stride, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
