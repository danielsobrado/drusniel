1. filename: beggar-appears.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, startled stillness; breath caught as the old man appears too close, hands hovering near her coin pouch. Night street in Riverhold as an old beggar seems to appear from nowhere in front of her with a hand extended, ragged clothes and matted beard, grime and damp fabric implying cheap wine and unwashed cloth; claustrophobic alley depth behind. A single overhead lamp is the key source, casting hard shadows and isolating them in a pool of light, while the rest of the street falls into cool darkness. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: coin-transformation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Los dedos del mendigo se cerraron alrededor del cobre.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of a copper coin in the beggar’s palm as his fingers close around it and the hand becomes suddenly steady, cracked nails and weathered skin telling poverty and age. Overhead lamp light creates warm specular highlights on the coin edge and wet grime, while the background drops into deep blur and shadow. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: beggar-prophecy.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El ahogamiento. Los ojos del mendigo estaban mirando a través de ella ahora")
prompt:Photorealistic close portrait of the beggar as his eyes snap into focus and then seem to look through Maris, mouth forming flat words like a script being read through him; Maris is a frozen edge-of-frame presence. Split lighting from the street lamp and deeper shadow makes his face feel unfamiliar without stylizing it, highlighting beard texture and cracked lips while the pupils hold unnatural clarity. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation on highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: beggar-wanders-off.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Se alejó tambaleándose ligeramente, ya olvidando su rostro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, hands trembling and face tight with pain behind her eyes as she watches him leave, trying to breathe through the spike of the message. Wide night shot after the conduit moment: the beggar already wandering away unsteadily down the street while Maris remains alone under the lamp, long empty perspective and damp stone textures stretching behind. Overhead lamp light leaves her in a harsh pool, while the street beyond falls into cool shadow and thin mist. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: wanderers-rest-sign.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Su cartel mostraba a un viajero con un bastón de caminar")
prompt:Photorealistic exterior of the inn El Descanso del Viajero at night: a hanging sign shows a traveler with a walking staff (no readable text) swinging slightly in wind as thin mist starts; warm light spills from windows onto wet street stones, muffled conversation inside. Window glow is the key source, amber reflections sliding across damp cobbles and painted wood grain, while the street edges fall into cold night shadow. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare from the windows, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
