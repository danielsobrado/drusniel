1. filename: beggar-appears.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: startled stillness, breath caught as the old man appears too close; hands hovering near her coin pouch. Night street in Riverhold as an old beggar seems to appear from nowhere with a hand extended, ragged clothes and matted beard, grime and damp fabric implying cheap wine and unwashed cloth; claustrophobic alley depth behind. A single overhead lamp is the key source, casting hard shadows and isolating them in a pool of light; the rest falls into cool darkness, interactive highlights glinting on wet stone. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: coin-transformation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Los dedos del mendigo se cerraron alrededor del cobre.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of a copper coin in the beggar’s palm as his fingers close around it and the hand becomes suddenly steady, cracked nails and weathered skin telling poverty and age. Overhead lamp light creates warm specular highlights on coin edge and wet grime; background drops into deep blur and shadow, interactive reflections sliding on the metal. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: beggar-prophecy.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El ahogamiento. Los ojos del mendigo estaban mirando a través de ella ahora")
prompt:Photorealistic close portrait of the beggar as eyes snap into focus and seem to look through Maris, mouth forming flat words like a script being read through him; Maris is a frozen edge-of-frame presence. Split streetlamp light and deeper shadow make his face feel unfamiliar without stylizing it, highlighting beard texture and cracked lips while pupils hold unnatural clarity, interactive highlights trembling in the eyes. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, subtle halation on highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: beggar-wanders-off.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Se alejó tambaleándose ligeramente, ya olvidando su rostro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Expression: hands trembling and face tight with pain behind her eyes as she watches him leave, trying to breathe through the spike of the message. Wide night shot after the conduit moment: the beggar already wandering away unsteadily down the street while Maris remains alone under the lamp, long empty perspective and damp stone textures stretching behind. Overhead lamp light leaves her in a harsh pool; the street beyond falls into cool shadow and thin mist, interactive bokeh glints on wet cobbles. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: wanderers-rest-sign.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Su cartel mostraba a un viajero con un bastón de caminar")
prompt:Photorealistic exterior of the inn El Descanso del Viajero at night: a hanging sign shows a traveler with a walking staff (no readable text) swinging slightly in wind as thin mist starts; warm light spills from windows onto wet street stones, muffled conversation inside. Window glow is the key source, amber reflections sliding across damp cobbles and painted wood grain; street edges fall into cold night shadow, interactive highlights glinting on iron. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare from the windows, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
