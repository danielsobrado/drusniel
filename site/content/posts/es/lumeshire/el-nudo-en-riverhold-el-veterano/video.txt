## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Eldric pushes through the market crowd without breaking stride, eyes snapping left and right; Sera fights to stay on his shoulder as muddy boots splash and a cart rattles past inches away.
[00:03-00:05] Eldric stops short and turns his head, locking onto something off-frame; the crowd surges between them, briefly swallowing the line of sight.
[00:05-00:08] He catches Sera by the sleeve and pulls her into a narrow side passage, pressing them to the wall as the street noise muffles and the unseen tail slips away.

Handheld tracking shot moving with Eldric through the crowd.
Audio: market chatter, wagon wheels on wet cobbles, boots splashing in mud, leather creak, a distant bell, short hard breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
