[00:00-00:03] Maris leans in and plants her elbows on the table; the candle flame steadies, then flickers as her breath tightens and the inn's noise dulls behind her.
[00:03-00:05] Xandor’s hands stop over the pots; a faint glow trembles through the leaves and a ceramic rim clicks softly as one cup shifts a fraction.
[00:05-00:08] She nods once, slow and final; the hearth crackle swells back in and the plants settle, the pattern holding as if it just accepted her.

Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
