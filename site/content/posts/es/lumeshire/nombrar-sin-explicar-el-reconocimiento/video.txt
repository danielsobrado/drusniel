## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Xandor’s hand hovers, then settles onto the cube; candle flames flutter as if the room inhales, and dust lifts from the table in slow spirals.
[00:03-00:05] The cube’s internal lines surge brighter and ripple outward; papers twitch and slide a fraction, blue reflections crawl across faces, and Maris flinches in the corner.

Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
