1. filename: Eldric-interrogates.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, controlled intensity; posture dominating the table, fingers splayed on the map as if pinning the story in place. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Drained steadiness, eyes heavy but alert. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Frustration held behind restless movement, half-risen like he cannot sit. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Watchful and uneasy, attention split between Eldric and the cube. In the cramped room above the Scholar’s Rest, Eldric interrogates details across a cluttered table with a rough Riverhold map, scattered notes, candle stubs, and the Beacon resting on pale silk, its dark metal cut with nonlinguistic geometric channels and a cold blue-white glow that makes the air feel tense. Warm candlelight from the table edge and wall sconces throws amber across faces, while the Beacon’s internal glow adds icy fill along knuckles and jawlines, deepening shadows in the corners. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, halation around the blue glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: sense-mode.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "como un faro que nunca deja de señalar")
prompt:Photorealistic close detail of the Beacon on silk at the center of the table, its dark metal surface etched with fine geometric grooves (no letters), one face subtly brighter as if oriented; the cold blue-white glow bleeds into the smoky air and catches drifting dust motes, making the room feel like it is quietly broadcasting. Candle flames nearby lean and flicker, their warm reflections warping faintly on the cube’s edges as if the air pressure changes around it. Mixed warm candlelight plus the Beacon’s cold internal glow, creating amber reflections on silk and icy edge highlights along the cube’s corners. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight focus falloff at the edges. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: blocked-roads.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Están vigilando cada camino principal fuera de la ciudad.")
prompt:Photorealistic exterior night at a Riverhold city gate in rain, slick cobblestones reflecting torchlight, armed silhouettes posted with purposeful spacing, wagon ruts and puddles, wet stone walls and ironwork slick with water. The feeling is organized pursuit: watchers who know what they are waiting for, holding the road without rushing. Torchlight and a lantern by the gatehouse provide the only illumination, warm orange pooling on wet stone and turning the falling rain into bright streaks against the dark. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, rain streaks visible, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: Eldric-targeted.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "ahora estaba girada casi directamente hacia él")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, disturbed recognition; pupils tight, jaw set as he realizes the cube has chosen him. The Beacon sits on silk at the table’s center with its luminous face now oriented almost directly toward Eldric, the cold glow sharpening the edges of his hands as they hover near the map without touching the cube; Dulint, Balin, and Xandor blur into the background as the room’s attention collapses to that alignment. The Beacon’s blue-white glow throws hard uplight onto Eldric’s lower face and fingertips, while a single candle behind him adds a warm rim that separates his profile from the dark. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare from candle flame, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: waiting-at-sunset.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "pintando Riverhold en tonos de naranja y rojo")
prompt:Photorealistic view out the upstairs window across Riverhold rooftops as the sun sinks, orange-red light washing tiles and chimneys while long shadows stretch into narrowing streets; thin smoke lines rise and dissolve into the cooling air. The composition carries an uneasy quiet, as if the city is settling into evening without knowing what is being signaled above it. Sunset light is warm and directional through the window glass, with interior candlelight faintly reflecting on the pane as soft amber ghosts. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, subtle lens flare, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
