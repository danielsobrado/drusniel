[00:00-00:03] The Beacon’s pulse tightens and brightens; symbols shift faster and the air around the cube ripples as nearby candle flames lean away.
[00:03-00:05] The pulse peaks; wax drips jump, a metal cup rattles once, and a hand slaps the tabletop to steady it as the room holds its breath.
[00:05-00:08] The light drops back to a steady throb; smoke curls upward again and the candle flames recover, leaving the cube quietly broadcasting.

Slow push-in toward the Beacon as the pulse intensifies.
Audio: candle hiss, faint metal resonance, ceramic tick, soft chair creak, cloth rustle, distant inn murmur muffled by the closed door. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
