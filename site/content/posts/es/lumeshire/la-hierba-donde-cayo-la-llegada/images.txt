1. filename: maris-enters-room.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, unsteady and overwhelmed; breath shallow, eyes locked on the cube as the silent scream hits. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Calm guide at her shoulder, already half turned toward the table. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Older dwarf leaning forward with weathered concern, ready to act. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Guarded suspicion held tight, posture closed. [Face_Reference: Balin] Younger dwarf with eager caution, eyes wide as he watches the Beacon react. Candlelit back room behind the common inn area: view from inside the room as Maris pauses in the doorway while the table conversation stops mid-breath; the Beacon sits at the center like a weight, dark metal cube with shifting symbols that refuse direct focus. Warm candlelight casts deep shadows on stone walls and worn wood grain, while the Beacon emits cold blue-white internal glow that distorts the air slightly and throws sharp cool highlights on knuckles and metal with subtle halation. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight lens flare from the Beacon glow. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: beacon-screaming.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "La palabra vino sin ser invitada.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, pressure in the chest and a forced breath; fingers tense against her sternum as the screaming becomes unbearable. Tight portrait as her gaze locks on the Beacon on the table, dark metal cube with shifting geometric symbols; candle flames smear into slight streaks from dizziness while the cube stays unnaturally sharp and heavy. The Beaconâ€™s cold blue-white glow is the key light, painting hard highlights on her iris reflections and fingertips, while candlelight adds warm amber that deepens the shadows under her eyes. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around the glow, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dulint-concerned.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Un cubo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, steady leadership and deep concern; leaning forward as he introduces himself with a hand extended. [Face_Reference: Balin] Photorealistic, eager curiosity edged with recent trauma; watching Maris with wide cautious eyes. Medium shot across the table in the candlelit back room: the Beacon sits in the center like a weight, dark metal cube with shifting symbols, while the two dwarves flank it with attention that keeps snapping back to the glow. Candlelight provides warm amber across faces and rough wood, while the Beaconâ€™s cold blue-white glow adds a thin rim on cheekbones and knuckles. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: Eldric-suspicious.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Actualmente justificado —dijo Eldric—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Photorealistic, justified suspicion held behind stillness; posture controlled, shoulders squared, eyes measuring Maris without softening. Profile portrait at the table in the candlelit back room, one hand resting close as if never fully unarmed; the Beaconâ€™s cold glow reflects faintly on his forearm. Candlelight carves sharp warm shadows across his face, while the Beacon adds a hard cool rim on cheek edge and collar. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-accepts-burden.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "La imagen estable se reprodujo una vez más. Barco. Agua. Mano.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, resolved though fearful; accepting the burden with a steady stare. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Weathered dwarf leadership, careful and protective. [Face_Reference: Balin] Younger dwarf urgency held in check, eyes flicking between Maris and the cube. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Suspicion tempered by grim reality. [Face_Reference: Xandor] Quiet certainty, watching patterns more than people. Closing group composition in the candlelit back room: Maris now seated at the table with the others forming a tense circle around the Beacon at the center, faces turned toward it and each other with wary resolve; wax drips, worn wood grain, and trembling shadows touch across the tabletop. Candlelight provides warm amber pools, while the Beaconâ€™s cold blue-white glow adds sharp cool highlights and faint air distortion with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight lens flare from the Beacon glow. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
