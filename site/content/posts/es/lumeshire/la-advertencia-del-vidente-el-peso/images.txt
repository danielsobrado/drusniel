1. filename: dulint-sleepless-by-hearth.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, sleepless tension; posture rigid and eyes fixed on the dying fire, hands clenched together as if holding back panic that would make others move too fast. Late-night inn common room with empty tables and benches receding into shadow, candle stubs and soot marks on the timber, a draft tugging at the door latch, and the sense of voices still echoing in the quiet after everyone else has gone to bed. Only light: warm ember glow from the hearth raking upward across his face and knuckles, with faint cold moonlight leaking through a distant window as thin rim light on shoulders and chair edges. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around embers, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: balin-comes-downstairs.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "EscuchÃ³ pasos en las escaleras y forzÃ³ su expresiÃ³n a algo que se pareciera a la calma.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Balin] Photorealistic, forced calm and quiet worry; Dulint holds his face still like a practiced lie, while Balin comes down the stairs slowly with a creased brow and a hesitating step when he sees the lone figure by the embers. Inn stairwell angle framing the empty room and the hearth corner, with scuffed travel gear set near the wall and dust hanging in the air like it has nowhere to go. Warm ember light from the hearth throws low orange flicker across the floorboards, while a dim lantern on the stairs spills weak yellow light downward and backlights Balin's outline. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dulint-forces-calm.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "La mentira saliÃ³ fÃ¡cilmente, suavizada por la repeticiÃ³n.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, calm that costs him; jaw clenched and eyes tired and haunted as he delivers a lie worn smooth by repetition, the strain visible in the tightness around his eyes before he forces it away. Tight portrait in the empty inn common room with benches and soot-stained walls falling into soft blur behind him, ash dust settled on the table edge and sleeve cuffs. Hearth embers provide a low warm orange flicker from below that makes shadows crawl up his cheeks, while faint cold window light adds a thin blue rim along his temple and shoulder. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, natural skin with pores, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: embers-stonehold-vision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Cuando Balin se fue, Dulint se volviÃ³ hacia el fuego moribundo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, dread returning; he leans forward and stares into the embers as if they can answer him, eyes reflecting firelight and a memory he cannot unsee. Over-the-shoulder view into the hearth where heat shimmer and shifting flame patterns briefly align into the suggestion of burning stone corridors and running silhouettes, like pareidolia in smoke, then collapse back into ordinary fire; ash drifts up and the room stays oppressively still. Ember glow from the hearth is the only strong light, warm orange flicker from low center, with a faint cold window spill barely outlining the edge of his shoulder and the hearth stones. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation in the brightest coals, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: dulint-carries-it-alone.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "LlevarÃ­a esto solo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] Photorealistic, decision to carry it alone; shoulders heavy, hands clasped, eyes fixed on the last coals as if measuring how much time is left before morning forces motion. Final solitary beat in the empty common room, chairs pushed in, candle stubs cold, soot in the wood grain, and the door draft making the ember glow pulse and dim. The hearth embers give the last warm orange light from low right, while faint moonlight through a distant window adds cold fill that turns the far corners into blue-grey silence. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
