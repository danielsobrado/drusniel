## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Water beads tremble on the edges of the footprint as a faint gust ripples the grass. Mud slowly slumps inward, threatening to soften the sharp ridges.
[00:03-00:05] Elric shifts his weight and leans closer, careful not to smear the mark, while Varian stays rigid and watches the treeline without blinking.
[00:05-00:08] The wind dies again and the forest goes perfectly still. A single twig snaps from between the trunks, and everyone freezes as seeped water darkens the center of the print.

Slow pull-back from the footprint to include the surrounding boots and the treeline.
Audio: wet mud squelch, leather and buckle creaks, distant wind through pine, soft drip of water, one sharp twig snap, held breath. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
