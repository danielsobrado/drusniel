1. filename: climb-to-outpost.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: grim focus, breath tight in the cold. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: irritated squint, jaw clenched. Grey dawn climb toward the frontier outpost on a hill, thick mud tugging at boots as Varian climbs with Elric one step behind, palisade and watch platform looming above through cold fog. Overcast daylight is the only light, flat grey fill; wet mud and wood catch dull specular highlights that bounce faintly up onto lower faces and cloak hems. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: rider-report.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "hombros encorvados como si hubieran cargado algo pesado durante kilómetros.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression: storm-ready restraint, eyes narrowed; hands planted on the desk. [Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: controlled tension, shoulders tight. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: sharp focus, seeing the wrong detail first. Two riders in mud-splattered cloaks face the desk with hunched shoulders, wet drips pooling on floorboards, grit tracked across wood. A single lantern flame is the only light, warm amber uplight catching cheekbones and knuckles; reflections slide across wet cloth and varnished wood grain, hard shadows falling behind the riders. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: night-watch-silence.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Nada más que el crujir de sus botas")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: tense vigilance, torch held low as he listens. Night watch at the palisade edge, forest line perfectly still beyond the wall with no wind and no birdsong. Torchlight is the primary light, warm and flickering; orange highlights ripple across wet timber and steel edges while moonlight adds a thin cold rim and the background stays near-black. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: rabbit-scare.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Un conejo aterrorizado que corrió entre los postes")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: sudden shock fading to grim restraint. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: shaky relief, laughing once the danger isn't real. A terrified rabbit sprints between palisade posts in a smear of motion, torchlight strobing on wet planks as weapons are half-drawn and then lowered. Torchlight patches are the primary illumination, warm and flickering; moonlight fills the dark with cold blue-grey, motion blur streaking the rabbit. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, motion blur, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: inhuman-prints.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "huellas, largas y abiertas, inconfundiblemente inhumanas")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian]. Expression: hard stare into the treeline, refusing to look away. [Face_Reference: Elric]. Expression: tight focus, crouched over the mark. Grey dawn at the treeline beyond the outpost, a small group standing in tense silence over long, splayed inhuman footprints pressed into wet ground, water beading at the edges. Cold morning light is the only illumination, diffuse and flat; wet mud ridges catch tiny specular points while the spaces between trunks stay dark, background softened. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
