1. filename: climb-to-outpost.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: grim focus, breath tight in the cold. [Face_Reference: Garrick] Expression: irritated squint, jaw clenched. Grey dawn climb toward the frontier outpost on a hill, thick mud tugging at boots as Varian climbs with Garrick one step behind, the palisade and watch platform looming above through cold fog, damp cloaks and leather gear flecked with mud. Overcast daylight is the only light, flat grey and diffused, catching pale highlights on wet wood, slick stone, and churned mud. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: rider-report.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "hombros encorvados como si hubieran cargado algo pesado durante kilómetros.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression: storm-ready restraint, eyes narrowed; hands planted on the desk. [Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: controlled tension, shoulders tight. [Face_Reference: Garrick] Expression: sharp focus, seeing the wrong detail first. Interior of Eldric's office as two riders in mud-splattered cloaks face the desk with hunched shoulders, wet drips pooling on floorboards and grit tracked across wood, the room tense and close. A single lantern flame throws warm amber light upward, hard shadows behind the riders, and a thin sheen of reflection on wet cloth and timber. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: night-watch-silence.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Nada más que el crujir de sus botas")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: tense vigilance, torch held low as he listens. Night watch at the edge of the palisade, Varian pacing with a torch while the forest line stays perfectly still with no wind and no birdsong, darkness pressing close beyond the wall. Torchlight is the primary light, warm and flickering, carving hard shadows on wet timber while cold moonlight adds faint blue rim to the posts. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: rabbit-scare.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Un conejo aterrorizado que corrió entre los postes")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: sudden shock fading to grim restraint, hands not quite steady. [Face_Reference: Garrick] Expression: shaky relief, laughing once the danger isn't real. A terrified rabbit sprints between palisade posts in a blur, torchlight strobing on wet planks as swords are half-drawn and then lowered, cold night air biting. Torchlight patches are the primary illumination, warm and flickering, with cold moonlight filling shadows to blue-grey. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, motion blur, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: inhuman-prints.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "huellas, largas y abiertas, inconfundiblemente inhumanas")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Varian] Expression: hard stare into the treeline, refusing to look away. [Face_Reference: Garrick] Expression: tight focus, crouched over the mark. Grey dawn at the treeline beyond the outpost as a small group stands in tense silence over long, splayed inhuman footprints pressed into wet ground, water beading at the edges while the forest reads like a wall. Cold morning light is the only illumination, diffuse and flat, catching wet highlights on mud ridges and boots while the spaces between trunks stay dark. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
