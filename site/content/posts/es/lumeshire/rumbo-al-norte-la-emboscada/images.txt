1. filename: ambush-erupts.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Already in motion, eyes locked, jaw tight; sword up and committing. [Face_Reference: Balin] Frozen for a beat, sword half-drawn, breath caught, eyes wide. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Backing toward center, pack clutched tight, shoulders hunched. The forest erupts from the right flank as Grukmar burst through wet underbrush with crude butcher-tools, branches snapping and moss flying; Eldric meets the first charge and Balin fights his feet to move. Overcast canopy light keeps everything cool and flat, while sparks from clashing metal throw brief warm flashes that streak across wet leaves and weapon edges. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: grukmar-face.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Balin captó un vistazo—piel gris-verdosa, demasiados dientes, un arma que parecía más herramienta de carnicero que espada—y luego Eldric se estaba moviendo, enfrentando la carga con una violencia que no coincidía con su apariencia curtida.")
prompt:Photorealistic extreme close-up of a Grukmar raider screaming as it breaks through brush, yellow eyes sharp with predatory focus, wet breath and spit catching in the air, crude armor scraped and muddy, a cleaver-like weapon raised just out of frame. The background is a smear of dark pine and snapped twigs, as if seen in a panicked half-second. Cool overcast forest light skims wet skin and mud as tiny silver highlights, with deep shadow under brow ridges and inside the mouth. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: defending-dulint.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Quien quiera esa mochila pasa por mí.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric] Expression cold and focused, shoulders squared, blade angled to guard and strike. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Eyes wide, pack clutched against chest, weight shifting backward. Eldric plants himself between Dulint and the attackers in a tight gap between trees, forcing the Grukmar into a narrow approach while leaf litter and mud kick up under boots. Diffuse overcast light silhouettes bodies through branches, and each metal impact throws tiny orange sparks that reflect as brief warm flecks on wet steel and glossy leaves. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, background slightly out of focus, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: balin-first-kill-moment.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Balin blandió.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] Eyes squeezed tight, mouth twisted, hands shaking on the hilt; terror driving the motion. Balin swings and the blade connects badly with a lunging Grukmar, black-dark blood spraying across his face as the creature still presses forward, too close to stop; the forest behind smears into blur from adrenaline. Overcast canopy light keeps skin and cloth muted, while wet blood catches a few sharp highlights and the blade edge shows a brief specular glint at the moment of impact. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur at the blade edge, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: aftermath-shock.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Balin miró su espada. La sangre.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] Drained and stunned, eyes fixed on the dripping blade, breath shallow; face spattered and uncomprehending. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Urgent and hard, hand yanking him by collar or shoulder, eyes already back on the fight. Balin stands over a fallen Grukmar for a heartbeat too long, sword dripping nearly black blood into wet leaves, while Eldric hauls him out of the freeze and the forest chaos blurs behind them. Cold overcast light makes the scene feel flat and unforgiving, with wet ground reflecting faint gray highlights and occasional warm flickers from distant sparks. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
