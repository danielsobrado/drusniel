1. filename: ambush-erupts.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Already in motion, eyes locked, jaw tight; sword up and committing. [Face_Reference: Balin]. Frozen for a beat, sword half-drawn, breath caught. [Face_Reference: Dulint]. Backing toward center, pack clutched tight, shoulders hunched. The forest erupts from the right flank as Grukmar burst through wet underbrush with crude butcher-tools, branches snapping and moss flying; Eldric meets the first charge and Balin fights his feet to move. Overcast canopy light stays cool and diffuse, bouncing green off wet needles into faces; sparks from clashing metal add brief warm flecks that reflect on wet steel and glossy leaves as tiny orange specular points while shadows remain dense. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: grukmar-face.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Balin captó un vistazo—piel gris-verdosa, demasiados dientes, un arma que parecía más herramienta de carnicero que espada—y luego Eldric se estaba moviendo, enfrentando la carga con una violencia que no coincidía con su apariencia curtida.")
prompt:Extreme close-up of a Grukmar raider screaming as it breaks through brush, yellow eyes sharp with predatory focus, wet breath and spit catching in the air, crude armor scraped and muddy, a cleaver-like weapon raised just out of frame. The background smears into pine needles and snapped twigs as if seen in a panicked half-second. Cool overcast forest light skims wet skin and mud as tiny silver highlights; moisture creates sharp specular points along teeth and lips, while deep shadow pools under brow ridges and inside the mouth. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: defending-dulint.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Quien quiera esa mochila pasa por mí.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Expression cold and focused, shoulders squared, blade angled to guard and strike. [Face_Reference: Dulint]. Eyes wide, pack clutched against chest, weight shifting backward. Eldric plants himself between Dulint and the attackers in a tight gap between trees, forcing a narrow approach while leaf litter and mud kick up under boots. Diffuse overcast light silhouettes bodies through branches; each metal impact throws tiny orange sparks that reflect as brief warm flecks on wet steel and glossy leaves, and damp ground bounces a faint green tint up into knuckles and jawlines. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, background slightly out of focus, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: balin-first-kill-moment.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Balin blandió.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]. Eyes squeezed tight, mouth twisted, hands shaking on the hilt. Balin swings and the blade connects badly with a lunging Grukmar, black-dark blood spraying across his face as the creature still presses forward. Overcast canopy light keeps cloth and skin muted; wet blood catches sharp specular highlights and the blade edge flashes a hard glint, while the forest behind drops into motion blur and cool shadow. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight motion blur at the blade edge, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: aftermath-shock.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Balin miró su espada. La sangre.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin]. Drained and stunned, eyes fixed on the dripping blade, breath shallow. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Urgent grip on collar or shoulder, eyes already back on the fight. Balin stands over a fallen Grukmar for a heartbeat too long while Eldric hauls him out of the freeze, wet leaves and mud spattered with nearly black blood underfoot. Cold overcast light creates flat gray highlights on wet ground; distant sparks flicker warm for an instant and reflect as tiny orange points in the glossy leaves before vanishing back into cool shadow. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
