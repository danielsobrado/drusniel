## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The bonfire burns normal amber for a beat. Magda lifts her staff higher, holding it steady as if pinning the air in place. Smoke thickens and begins to spiral upward.
[00:03-00:05] The fire snaps to sickly green in an instant. Shadows stretch unnaturally across faces and timber walls; a few villagers recoil and raise hands to shield their eyes.
[00:05-00:08] The green glow pulses once, then steadies. Embers rise like sparks from wet wood, glowing green before fading to black. Magda lowers the staff a fraction, keeping the crowd frozen in silence.

Slow dolly in from the crowd toward Magda's raised staff.
Audio: fire crackle shifting pitch, wind pushing smoke, a collective sharp inhale from the crowd, wooden beams creaking under heat, low hum that cuts out on the pulse. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
