1. filename: dulint-approaches-cave.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, determined and tense; shoulders squared into the climb, breath visible, and one gloved hand gripping rock while the weight of a wrapped artifact case pulls at his pack straps. Above the treeline on a steep mountain path, snow crust and exposed stone alternate underfoot, a sheer drop falls away beside the trail, and a dark cave mouth cuts into the slope like a waiting wound. Cold mountain daylight filtered through thin cloud flattens color into blue-grey, with hard wind-driven spindrift catching highlights along the path edge and a faint rim of pale sun outlining the cave lip. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: seer-waiting.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Ella estaba esperando cuando llegó, como si hubiera sabido que venía.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Seer, Dulint] Photorealistic, waiting without emotion; the Seer sits near a small fire at the cave threshold with a stillness that reads like certainty, while Dulint stands just inside the entrance, hesitant, as if the mountain itself told her he would come. Rough cave stone is damp with frost melt and soot smears, thin smoke drifting between them, and the bright snow outside makes the interior feel smaller and more private. Warm firelight from low center paints amber uplight across hands and cheekbones and throws sharp moving shadows onto the rock, while cold daylight from the entrance backlights the smoke into a pale blue haze and silhouettes Dulint's shoulders. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation around the flame, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dulint-hears-failure.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las palabras golpearon como un golpe físico.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, shock landing like impact; eyes wide, jaw tight, and breath caught mid-inhale as he absorbs the verdict, one hand braced against the cold cave wall to keep himself steady. The Seer sits blurred in the background near the fire, unreadable, while ash and dust hang in the air and the cave mouth behind him leaks cold light. Firelight from the side adds warm orange on one cheek and knuckles, while the cave entrance gives cold rim light that sharpens the edge of his profile and turns the suspended smoke into a faint blue veil. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: seer-warns-slowly.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Lentamente. Una palabra. La dijo como si contuviera todo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Seer] Photorealistic, prophetic severity without drama; she leans a fraction closer and shapes the single word with a mouth barely moving, eyes fixed past Dulint as if watching the pattern continue. Extreme close-up with smoke ribbons crossing the frame, fire popping softly out of focus below, and the rest of the cave dropping into black. The small fire provides warm orange uplight from below that carves deep shadows into the face and hands, with a faint cold daylight trace from the entrance adding a thin edge highlight along one cheek and eyelid. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight softness at edges, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: dulint-leaves-burdened.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Dejó la cueva con conocimiento que no podía compartir")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, burdened descent; head bowed and shoulders heavy as he steps away from the cave, leaving only footprints cutting through new snow. The camera looks past him into a vast cold landscape of ridgelines and distant valleys fading into haze, the treeline far below, and the cave mouth behind reduced to a dark notch in stone. Late-day mountain light sits low and weak behind cloud, casting long muted shadows and turning windblown snow into bright drifting streaks at ground level. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight barrel distortion, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
