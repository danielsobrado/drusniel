1. filename: xandor-explains-phases.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor] Photorealistic, controlled urgency; hands moving fast as he lays out a five-part structure he still cannot fully explain. [Face_Reference: Eldric] Hard attention, posture like a soldier receiving an uncomfortable report. [Face_Reference: Dulint] Quiet focus, weighing risk against duty. [Face_Reference: Balin] Restless intensity, leaning in to catch every word. [Face_Reference: Maris] Tight and guarded, eyes sharp as the implications land. Over-the-shoulder view from behind Xandor as his fingers trace a five-part diagram in dust and ash on the tabletop beside the pulsing Beacon cube; charred fragments and scattered notes crowd the wood, and the others gather around in a cramped tavern back room. Warm candlelight rakes across table grain and ash lines from the right, while the cube's cold blue-white pulse rises from the left and throws moving geometry that slides across hands and paper edges. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, dust haze in the air, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: erase-memory.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Removiendo memorias? ¿Puede hacer eso?")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] Photorealistic, sharp alarm; jaw tight as she stares at proof she does not want to imagine. Medium close shot of Maris reacting over the table as a parchment page lies scraped clean down to scarred fibers, knife-scrape marks visible where dark ink used to be; the Beacon cube sits nearby, pulsing softly, and ash dust clings to the page edges. Candlelight grazes the parchment from a low angle, revealing raised fibers and scratches, while the cube adds cold blue highlights along the torn edge and across Maris's cheek. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight reflection sheen on paper, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: rewrite-reality.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "O lo que fue en lo que nunca sucedió.")
prompt:Photorealistic uneasy wide shot of the tavern back room with the Beacon cube on the table, candle flames streaking slightly as if time mis-registered; the room edges feel subtly wrong from lens distortion and motion, like two nearly identical moments overlapped. Chairs, wall plaster, and hanging smoke haze show faint double-image drift, while the table and cube remain crisp, making the space look rewritten without turning into fantasy effects. The cube provides cold blue-white pulses that catch on drifting dust and make shadows jump, while candles provide warm amber that smears into soft streaks at the edges of the frame. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: burned-libraries.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Los textos terminan en fuego. Páginas quemadas")
prompt:Photorealistic tabletop still life of ruined knowledge: half-burned manuscripts and charred scrolls scattered across the table, curled pages with blackened edges, ash smudges, and broken wax seals, the room beyond lost to darkness. A low flame catches the paper pile, providing the only light source, hot orange and yellow that throws hard moving shadows and bright specular highlights on melted wax, while soot lifts into the air in slow sheets. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, smoke haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: incomplete-danger.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Y no tenemos idea de qué sucederá cuando los encuentre.")
prompt:Photorealistic ominous object metaphor: the Beacon cube sits on the table amid ash and charred fragments, and around it are four faint empty impressions in the dust where other pieces might fit, like missing parts of a locked system. Each pulse pushes cold light outward and makes the ash outlines shimmer and soften at the edges, while candlelight adds warm reflections that slide along the cube corners and pick out the wood grain. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
