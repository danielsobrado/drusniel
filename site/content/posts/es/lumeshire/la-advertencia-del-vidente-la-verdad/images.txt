1. filename: dulint-maris-campfire.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Maris] Photorealistic, midnight camp confession; Dulint sits rigid on first watch with tired eyes and a guarded jaw, while Maris settles beside him close to the embers, exhausted but steady, watching him as if she can read the weight he carries. Their makeshift camp is sparse: bedrolls and packs in a rough circle, damp grass and dirt underfoot, tree silhouettes and open dark beyond the fire's reach, the Beacon kept nearby like a second heartbeat. Fire embers and a low campflame cast warm orange up-light that flickers across faces and gloved hands, while cold moonlight rims shoulders from behind and the Beacon's faint blue pulse leaks through cloth near the edge of frame. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation around firelight, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: beacon-glows-in-pack.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El Faro pulsaba cerca, su suave brillo")
prompt:Photorealistic artifact close-up; the Beacon's cold blue-white pulse seeping through wrapped cloth inside a travel pack, illuminating frayed stitching, leather straps, and nearby gear edges (boot leather, metal buckle, blade sheath) with no readable writing. The fabric weave and embedded dirt grit are tack-sharp, and the glow makes the pack feel alive for a beat. The Beacon's internal light is the key source, pushing icy highlights through the cloth and casting hard-edged shadows on adjacent objects, while a weak warm campfire spill adds faint amber contamination at the frame edge. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-sees-vision.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Veo fuego, admitiÃ³ finalmente.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Maris] Photorealistic, quiet confrontation; Maris leans toward Dulint as he admits the vision of fire, her eyes glossy and intent, brows pulled tight with empathy and alarm she refuses to show too loudly, while Dulint stays just behind her shoulder as a blurred, tense presence. The camp around them is almost swallowed by darkness, only embers and scattered gear catching light, the Beacon's pulse continuing nearby like a cold heartbeat. Firelight from below warms lower planes of faces and hands, while moonlight adds a cool rim along the far cheek and shoulder, creating mixed color shadows that shift subtly with the flame. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: dulint-hides-truth.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "No puedo controlar lo que sÃ©. Pero puedo controlar cÃ³mo afecta a los otros.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Photorealistic, refusal to share; he turns away from Maris and stares into the darkness beyond the camp, jaw locked and eyes hard, one hand tightening on a strap or weapon haft as if the night itself might answer. The fire behind him throws long moving shadows across damp ground and the nearest packs, emphasizing the distance he creates by looking away. Cold moonlight outlines his profile from behind, while the campfire adds a warm edge-light on cheek and knuckles, the two sources fighting across his face in a split of blue and amber. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: maris-watches-dulint.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Ella lo mirÃ³ como si supiera que habÃ­a mÃ¡s.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint, Maris] Photorealistic, aftermath of the argument; Maris watches Dulint's back as he faces the dark, her expression tight with judgment and sorrow, hands held still as if forcing herself not to reach for him. The fire has sunk lower and the camp feels smaller, with the Beacon's pulse continuing in the pack like a reminder neither can silence. Fading firelight provides weak warm fill that flickers in Maris's eyes and across gear scuffs, while moonlight builds a cold rim on Dulint's shoulders and the treeline beyond, deepening the shadows between them. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur from fire flicker, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
