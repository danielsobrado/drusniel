1. filename: xandor-explains-beacon.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Xandor]. Composed but strained; hands gesturing as he forces fragments into a warning. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Practical calm with worry under it. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Eager energy held back, leaning forward. [Face_Reference: Eldric]. Suspicion sharpened into certainty, ready to move. [Face_Reference: Maris]. Pale and drawn, fighting constant pressure. Tavern back room with the Beacon cube pulsing on the table amid charred papers and scattered fragments, the group gathered close in tense silence. Cube throws cold blue-white spill upward that crawls across cheekbones and fingers and makes shadows stretch long; candle adds warm amber from the side, bouncing off paper fibers and leaving ember-like reflections in wet eyes, with dust haze visible in both beams. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: Eldric-realization.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Nos están rastreando, dijo Eldric. No era una pregunta.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Eldric]. Grim certainty; hand on hilt, eyes locked on the window as if listening for footsteps. He turns toward the street-facing glass while the table and cube fall into soft blur behind. Wet stone and faint mist outside, darkness close to the pane, reflections layered in the glass. Cold window light provides flat blue-grey fill; cube pulse and candle inside add thin warm-cold bands that stripe jawline and window frame, with glare highlights moving across the glass as he shifts. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight reflection glare, background softly out of focus. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-screaming-silence.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Maris se rio, y el sonido fue afilado y amargo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris]. Bitter laugh breaking into exhaustion; one hand pressed to her temple, eyes wet and tired. She glares toward the cube as the rest of the room collapses into shadow and smoke-haze. Cube pulse cuts cold blue-white across skin texture and catches as hard specular points in the eyes; candlelight stays warm and dim on the far wall, creating a harsh split of warm edge and cold fill, with halation blooming around the pulse and faint motion blur in her trembling hand. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: wyrmreach-vision.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La mano ahogándose. El agua negra.")
prompt:Vision flash of black water like thick oil swallowing light as a long-fingered hand breaks the surface and sinks back under, bubbles tearing off the knuckles. Starless red-grey twilight above as a faint smear, water surface tension behaving wrong, highlights snapping along ripples. Sickly cold glow from below is the only light, turning the water into black glass with hard interactive highlights; everything above falls into near-darkness with halation blooming at the glow edge. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: beacon-pulse.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El Faro pulsó sobre la mesa, su luz suave de alguna manera más ominosa ahora.")
prompt:Ominous object shot of the Beacon cube isolated on worn wood grain, pulsing softly as if sending a signal, candle wax drips and charred fragments soft at the edges. Each pulse pushes cold blue-white light outward across the table, making shadows shift and candle flames bend slightly, dust haze visible near the surface. Cube glow provides cold underlight; candle provides warm side light that reflects in thin bands on metal edges and creates tiny warm points on dust and varnished wood pores. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
