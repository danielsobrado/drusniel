1. filename: sage-examines-ancient-book.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Eyes narrowed in careful focus; gloved fingers tense as the leather resists. Sage Meridia lifts the cracked cover of an ancient tome and the binding splits like dried skin, releasing a faint plume of ash that hangs in still air; she sits at a cluttered desk in a vaulted archive, shelves of scroll cases receding into darkness, a brass candelabra of five flames reflected in polished wood. Candlelight is the only illumination, warm amber that falls off fast into shadow; ash particles catch the light as floating points while the page edges glow unevenly through water damage. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around candle flames. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: sage-pays-merchant.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Le pagó al mercader el doble de lo que pedía. Él se fue rápidamente, como aliviado de deshacerse de su carga.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Hand extended with coins; expression unreadable, all caution. In her study doorway, Meridia pays a hooded merchant who leans away as if eager to leave; thin rain falls in the cobblestone alley behind him, cloak dripping; the ancient book sits wrapped in oilcloth on the desk behind her. Cool overcast daylight from the open door washes the merchant in grey while a small oil lamp inside throws warm amber across Meridia's glove and the wrapped book, creating a hard warm-cold split at the threshold. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: sage-reads-about-gods.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Cada voz estaba segura. Cada voz estaba segura de manera diferente.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Eyes narrowed; fingertip tracing a line as if trying to hold it still; fatigue gathering at the corners. Meridia leans over the open book at her desk, surrounded by multiple pages of notes arranged in three columns with headings not readable; the ancient margins are crowded with arguments in different inks, and crumpled drafts litter the floor. A single beeswax taper provides warm directional light that throws her shadow large across shelves and makes ink ages show as different tones; the rest of the room falls away into black. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: sage-studies-marginal-notes.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La mano marginal estaba de vuelta, más afilada ahora:")
prompt:Extreme macro of an open manuscript page: angular bronze-tinted script and marginalia in multiple hands, one note violently scratched out leaving torn fibers; a gloved fingertip rests beside the obliterated line, modern quill and ink pot at the edge; no readable words. Candlelight just out of frame provides warm sidelight that turns bronze ink into faint metallic sheen and throws micro-shadows into the torn paper terrain. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Ektar 100, razor-thin focal plane, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: sage-contemplates-contradictions.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "La Academia no toma posición oficial sobre autenticidad.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Exhaustion around the eyes; shoulders heavy; book held with care like a weight. In a restricted archive corridor, Meridia slides the closed tome onto a shelf beside other aged texts while her notebook hangs open in her other hand, final page blank except for a single line of handwriting not readable; brass section placards glint faintly. A wall oil lamp far down the corridor provides a distant amber glow that leaves her mostly in shadow, giving only edge-light along book spines and a thin highlight on the notebook paper. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
