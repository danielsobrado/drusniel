[00:00-00:03] Meridia lifts the cover another inch. The leather binding cracks audibly and a visible plume of fine ash rises from the pages, drifting upward through candlelight.
[00:03-00:05] The five candle flames flicker in response to the displaced air. Ash particles swirl in warm glow, spiraling toward the vaulted ceiling.
[00:05-00:08] The ash plume thins, but motes keep floating, catching light as they pass through darker air. Meridia steadies the book with both hands, refusing to blink.

Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
