1. filename: sage-studies-map-of-astalor.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Leaning close, eyes scanning routes; fingertip steady on a contested border line. Sage studies a massive hand-painted map of Astalor spread across an oak campaign table in a tall council chamber; carved terrain markers and tokens pin key regions while rolled comparison maps wait at the edge; the map contains labels and notes but no readable words. Overcast daylight from high arched windows provides cool even light across parchment and wood, with deep shadows under the table and a few hard glints on brass dividers and compass tools. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, deep depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: sage-observes-contian-towers.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Bajo la superficie, las facciones compiten por el control.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Cloak pulled tight; one hand shielding her eyes; expression: wary appraisal. From a stone balcony, she watches the Contian skyline: pale mage towers rise above a walled city, spires crackling with intermittent blue-white arcane discharge while thin unnatural fog coils between rooftops and banners hang from different towers. Each arcane flash becomes a diegetic light source, throwing brief sharp shadows before dusk reclaims the scene in muted amber-grey; fog scatters both colors into a smeared glow between streets. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation in the flash. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: sage-witnesses-stonehold-forge.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El sonido de los martillos sobre los yunques nunca cesa.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Heat-slicked focus; jaw set; eyes reflecting orange light. On a carved stone gallery, she overlooks Stonehold's Forgeheart: molten channels run like rivers below, dwarven smiths work in rhythmic overlap, and a massive drop-hammer throws a spray of sparks as it strikes glowing steel. The molten metal provides dominant diegetic light, hot orange-white uplight that paints faces and vaulted stone; sparks streak through the air and create brief bright pinpoints on iron edges. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: sage-visions-grukmar-horde.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Viven para la batalla, para la emoción de la conquista.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Hood up, face held in shadow; breath shallow; body pressed low behind cover. From a ridge, she watches a Grukmar war camp: mud-staked hide tents, spike barricades, goblins scurrying with weapons, and a central bonfire sending greasy black smoke upward while larger shapes move deeper in the camp. Bonfire and cook-fires provide warm low uplight that fights the grey overcast, turning smoke into a dirty orange column and leaving the camp in murky low contrast with no clean shadows. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, compressed perspective. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: sage-gazes-towards-wyrmreach.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "En canciones y leyendas, los viajeros susurran acerca de cosas terribles en esa tierra lejana — horrores más allá de la comprensión mortal y sombras que desafían toda descripción — pero pocos de los que viajan allí regresan para confirmar qué es verdad.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Sage] Wind-battered and braced; one hand gripping wet stone; eyes fixed on the horizon. On a coastal cliff in driving rain, she faces a dark storm sea; far out, Wyrmreach forms an unnatural silhouette through cloud and spray while lightning flickers inside the distant storm without touching ground. Storm light is cold and directionless until a lightning fork backlights the horizon, outlining the distant landmass in stark white for an instant and turning rain streaks into bright lines. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, salt spray on the lens edge. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
