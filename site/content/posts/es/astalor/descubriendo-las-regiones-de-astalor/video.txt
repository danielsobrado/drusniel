## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The massive drop-hammer rises, the glowing billet dimming slightly as air hits it. Smiths brace, tongs locked tight.
[00:03-00:05] The hammer slams down. A radial burst of sparks erupts and arcs outward; the molten channel nearest the anvil ripples in response to the vibration.
[00:05-00:08] Sparks hiss as they strike wet stone and die. The billet flares brighter for a beat, then settles back to a steady glow as the forge rhythm resumes.

Static wide shot from the gallery railing.
Audio: deep metallic clang, overlapping anvil rhythm, hiss of sparks on damp stone, low roar of molten channels, brief shouted warning without intelligible words. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
