1. filename: mental-connection.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Eyes wet, breath held; fingers white-knuckled in the sheets as the connection strengthens. Drusniel sits upright in bed in a near-dark stone room, one hand half-reaching into empty air as if listening with his whole body. A thin thread of warm amber light seems to hang in the air near his temple, faintly tracing the direction of the unseen presence, while cold cyan spill from a distant corridor glow outlines his cheek and knuckles. Canon EOS R5, 50mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: headache-strain.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Un dolor sordo detrás de sus ojos.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Brow knotted, jaw tight; pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes as the strain hits. Tight portrait on the bed, knees pulled up close, shoulders hunched as if bracing against a wave, the room around him dropping away into shadow. The only light is the low cyan spill from under the door, with a faint warm flicker bleeding across his fingers and eyelids as the connection pulses and costs him. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: annariel-isolation.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Aislamiento completo.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Annariel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: too focused, lips barely parted; holding still like he's afraid to breathe. Annariel sits alone in a sealed stone isolation chamber, back to a smooth wall, hands resting on his knees, the heavy door and inlaid warding circle visible on the floor around him. Cold cyan bioluminescence from fungus in the wall cracks gives the room its only light, painting hard blue edges on his cheekbones and leaving the rest to near-black; any inscriptions remain unreadable texture. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: zaelar-mention.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Su nombre es Zaelar.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression shifting from relief to wary calculation, lips parted as if repeating the name under his breath. Close portrait in the dark, shoulders sunk into the pillow, one hand hovering near his mouth as he tests the weight of "Zaelar" on his tongue. Cold cyan spill under the door carves one side of his face; a fading warm amber afterglow clings to the other cheekbone, halation softening the edge as the connection thins. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: fading-connection.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Entonces la presencia se fue.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Hand outstretched, fingers splayed; a flash of panic as the connection drops. Medium shot of Drusniel in bed reaching into empty air, the amber thread of light collapsing into nothing a heartbeat before his fingertips close, leaving only darkness and the cold stone around him. The warm glow dies mid-fade, and the remaining cyan corridor spill under the door feels suddenly weaker, shadows swallowing the frame. Sony A7R IV, 50mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
