## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel and Shyntara sprint through choking smoke as torchlight flickers in broken pulses. Dust drifts from the ceiling with each distant impact.
[00:03-00:05] A deep crack rolls overhead. Shyntara yanks Drusniel back a half step as stones start to fall; the smoke bursts outward from the shock like a wave.
[00:05-00:08] The ceiling slams down between them in a violent cascade. Sparks and grit explode; Drusniel staggers, blinking through dust, then surges toward the rubble as the far side disappears behind rolling smoke.

Handheld pull-back down the corridor as they run, ending at the collapse.
Audio: distant steel clang, torch crackle, stone groan, debris impacts, dust cough, ragged breathing, smoke hiss. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
