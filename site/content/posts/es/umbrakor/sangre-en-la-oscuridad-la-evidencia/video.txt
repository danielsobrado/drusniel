## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel kneels close, gripping Meren’s wrist as the old steward struggles for breath. Lantern light trembles across the stone as dust drifts in the air.
[00:03-00:05] Meren’s fingers slacken and slide free. A wet cough shudders his chest once, then stops; the corridor settles into a heavy, ringing silence.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel’s gaze drops to the dagger near Meren’s hand. He reaches out, lifts it with shaking fingers, and closes his fist as the lantern flame gutters.

Slow dolly-in from the corridor toward Drusniel and Meren.
Audio: lantern hiss, wet cough, fabric rustle, distant water drip, shallow breathing that fades, metal scrape as the dagger lifts. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
