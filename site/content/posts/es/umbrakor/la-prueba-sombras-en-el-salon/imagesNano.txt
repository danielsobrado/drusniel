1. filename: father-at-gate.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Exhaustion and dread, approaching from dark tunnel, ash on collar. [Face_Reference: Father]. Standing in silhouette, arms crossed, posture wide, braced for bad news. Night arrival at the gate of a drow family compound. Wet obsidian stone underfoot, bioluminescent fungi on compound walls cast cold teal backlight that outlines the father's silhouette and reflects off wet flagstones between them as interactive teal highlights on the pooled water. Darkness of the tunnel behind Drusniel swallows all detail. Shadows on wet stone tinged teal at edges where fungal light reaches. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, rain-dampened lens edge softening corners. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: mother-cold-reception.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Sus manos estaban frías.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Rigid, ash on throat, shock behind eyes. [Face_Reference: Mother]. Touching his face with cool hands, carefully blank expression. [Face_Reference: Shyntara]. Arms crossed beside mother, sharp watchful eyes. Interior foyer of drow estate, dark stone walls and carved archways. Cold teal bioluminescent wall fungi from the left and warm amber oil lantern from the right create mixed interactive lighting on the mother's hands and Drusniel's face, teal on one side and amber on the other. Shadows beneath the archway tinged split between cool teal and warm amber. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, slightly warm color cast. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: shyntara-suspicion.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Sus ojos se fijaron en Drusniel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara]. Eyes hard, locked on target, suspicion crystallized, predatory focus. Pale hairline, blade training scars along jaw edge. Tight close portrait. Cool bioluminescent corridor light casts teal sidelight along one cheekbone, the light reflects in her dark pupils as a small interactive teal point. Opposite side falls to deep shadow. Hallway behind dissolved to dark blur. One strand of hair crossing her forehead. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM, Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: father-study.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Trofeos de tres generaciones.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father]. Behind scarred wooden desk, both hands flat, jaw working. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Standing across desk, tension visible. [Face_Reference: Shyntara]. Closing door behind her, alert. Cramped study packed with weapons on walls: knives of every design hanging from hooks. Warm oil lamp on desk casts strong amber uplight onto the father's face and downlight onto scarred wood grain, each blade on the wall catches a small interactive amber glint from the lamp. Dust motes visible in the cone of lamplight. Shadows in study corners dense and warm. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, dust visible in light beam. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: drusniel-tracing-walls.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Un hueco donde algo había sido tallado.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Distant expression, numb, eyes unfocused. Fingers tracing old knife marks and scratches on stone wall, searching for a pattern. Standing apart from the room, family voices off-frame. Weapons blurred in background. Low warm lamplight from behind him casts his shadow onto the wall, the scratches and gouges catch light at their chiseled edges as fine interactive highlight lines. Fingertip slightly blurred from motion. Shadow of his hand falls across the carved marks. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, warm undertone, natural skin texture. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
