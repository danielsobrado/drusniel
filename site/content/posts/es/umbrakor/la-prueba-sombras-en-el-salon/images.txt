1. filename: father-at-gate.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Exhaustion and dread, approaching from the dark tunnel with ash on his collar. [Face_Reference: Father] Standing in silhouette against bioluminescent glow from the family compound, arms crossed, posture wide, braced for bad news. Night arrival at the gate of a drow family estate, wet obsidian stone and bioluminescent fungi on the compound walls casting cold teal backlight that outlines the father's silhouette and reflects off the wet flagstones between them. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, rain-dampened lens edge. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: mother-cold-reception.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Sus manos estaban frías.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Standing rigid, ash on throat, shock behind his eyes. [Face_Reference: Mother] Touching his face with cool hands, expression carefully blank. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] Beside the mother, arms crossed, sharp watchful eyes. Interior foyer of a drow estate with dark stone walls and carved archways. Bioluminescent wall fungi casting cold teal ambient from the left, a warm oil lantern on a wall bracket casting amber from the right, the two light sources mixing on the mother's hands and Drusniel's face. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, slightly warm color cast from lantern. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shyntara-suspicion.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Sus ojos se fijaron en Drusniel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Eyes hard and locked on target, suspicion crystallized, predatory focus. Pale hairline catching cool light, blade training scars visible along her jaw edge. Tight close portrait with shallow depth of field, the hallway behind her dissolved to dark blur. Cool bioluminescent fungi light from the corridor casting teal sidelight along one cheekbone, the opposite side of her face falling to deep shadow. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, one strand of hair crossing her forehead. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: father-study.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Trofeos de tres generaciones.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father] Behind a scarred wooden desk with both hands flat on the surface, jaw working. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Standing across the desk, tension in his posture. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] Closing the door behind her, alert and focused on her father. Cramped study packed with weapons on the walls: knives of every design hanging from hooks like trophies. Warm oil lamp on the desk casting strong amber light upward onto the father's face and downward onto the scarred wood, weapons on the walls catching glints. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, dust visible in the lamplight. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI.

5. filename: drusniel-tracing-walls.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Un hueco donde algo había sido tallado.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Distant expression, numb, eyes unfocused. Fingers tracing old knife marks and scratches on a stone wall, searching for a pattern that is not there. Standing slightly apart from the room, family voices off-frame. Weapons blurred in the background. Low warm lamplight from behind him casting his shadow onto the wall, the scratches and gouges catching light at their edges. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, fingertip slightly blurred from motion. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
