## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] A wave surges into the hidden cove and detonates into white spray against the jagged rocks. Mist rolls into the cave mouth in a sudden cold breath.
[00:03-00:05] The boat shifts and knocks softly against stone, rope lines snapping taut and vibrating. Waterlight flickers across the cave ceiling in broken moving bands.
[00:05-00:08] The surge drains back out, dragging foam and loose pebbles with it. Spray falls in slow drops as the cave returns to a tense, wet stillness.

Slow pan from the black rocks down into the cave mouth and onto the boat.
Audio: crashing surf, rock grind, rope creak, spray hiss, dripping water inside the cave, distant wind over the coastline. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
