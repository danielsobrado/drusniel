1. filename: map-overview.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar] Leaning over the desk with calm control, one hand anchored on the map. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Guarded posture held back from the desk, eyes narrowed, attention fixed on what he is being shown. Zaelar's entire desk is covered by a massive surface-world map, dense with coastlines, mountain ridges, forest markings, and hand-drawn warning symbols around the eastern sea, with any labels and writing kept blurred and unreadable. Warm lamplight pools across paper fibers and ink stains while cool grey daylight from the window adds a thin rim along the map edge and their sleeves, creating a warm-cool split across the desk. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, natural skin with pores. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: pointing-finger.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "â€”Wyrmreach â€”dijo Zaelar, trazando la costa con un dedo largoâ€”. La tierra mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la barrera.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar] Fingertip steady and precise, pressing hard enough to wrinkle the paper slightly. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Watching with narrowed eyes and controlled suspicion, hands held careful and still. Close two-shot at the edge of the map as Zaelar indicates the far eastern coastline; inked wave-lines and warning marks crowd the sea margin, and any labels remain out of focus and unreadable. A single desk lamp casts warm amber at a low angle, making paper fibers and ink sheen pop, with a faint cool window fill softening shadows. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: looking-out-window.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "â€”Quiero que lo consideres.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar] Standing at the window with his back half-turned, posture rigid, a pause that feels calculated. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Still by the desk, watching Zaelar's back, suspicion tightening his mouth, hands held carefully still. The huge map remains spread across the desk behind them, papers and rolled edges curling, tea steam fading into the air while the room goes quiet. Cold grey daylight from the window silhouettes Zaelar and washes the stone wall, while a warm desk lamp behind Drusniel throws amber across the map and catches dust motes suspended in the mixed light. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: boat-cave.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Busca las rocas negras con forma de dientes rotos.")
prompt: Stormy coastline at dusk: jagged black rocks like broken teeth crowd the shore, hiding a narrow cove where waves slam and retreat in foaming sheets. In the shadowed mouth of a low sea cave, a small reinforced boat sits half-pulled onto slick stone, rope lines taut, spray misting the air. Overcast sky provides cold blue-grey ambient light, while reflected waterlight flickers up onto wet rock faces, creating moving highlights and deep shadow pockets inside the cave. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: warning-signs-map.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel mirÃ³ el mapa, el tramo de agua entre Astalor y Wyrmreach marcado con sÃ­mbolos de advertencia.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Focused dread held behind control, fingertips hovering above the paper as if measuring distance without touching. Macro-to-medium view of the sea crossing section of the map, dense with hand-drawn warning symbols, ink smudges, and scratched corrections, with any labels kept blurred and unreadable; a rolled map edge and desk clutter fall away into soft focus. Warm lamplight glances across slightly glossy ink, creating tiny specular reflections that make the warning marks feel alive, while the rest of the desk sinks into shadow. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
