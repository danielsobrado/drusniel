## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The horizon shifts with a slow impossible motion; a glossy glint opens and holds for a beat as dust trembles on the rock near his hands.
[00:03-00:05] He presses lower behind the outcropping, breath held; a faint pulse begins under his pack flap, light leaking through a seam.
[00:05-00:08] The glint fades and the rumble rolls away; he slides one knee deeper into shadow, keeping the leaking pulse covered as the red light stays flat and sunless.

Slow pull back that reveals the crushing scale between him and the horizon.
Audio: distant low rumble, rising wind, grit sliding on stone, cloth strain, muffled breath, faint artifact throb, far wave slap. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
