1. filename: zaelar-calculating.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] drow with blueish ash skin color, Calm calculation, fingers steepled, gaze weighing Drusniel like an interesting problem. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Breathless urgency from training, sweat at the hairline, trying to keep his voice steady as he admits the threat. Medium two-shot inside Zaelar’s study: desk cluttered with odd instruments, ink pots, and old books with no legible writing; hundreds of hourglasses tick on shelves and ledges, dust motes drifting through still air. A desk oil-lamp is the warm diegetic key light, throwing amber across Zaelar’s hands and the desk surface; cooler window spill (thin and indirect) adds a faint blue edge on glass hourglasses and book corners, with deep shadow pooling behind Drusniel. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation around the lamp flame, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: interrogation.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Demasiado específico. Las preguntas eran demasiado específicas para simple curiosidad.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Unease surfacing, eyes narrowing as the questions become tactical instead of helpful; chest still rising from exertion. [Face_Reference: Zaelar] drow with blueish ash skin color, Measured calm, voice gentle but intent, posture relaxed like this is routine. Interrogation-like composition in the study: Drusniel stands in a tight pool of lamp light beside the desk while Zaelar remains seated just outside it, hourglasses and scattered papers framing them, everything feeling suddenly like an interview. The oil-lamp’s warm amber cone creates hard falloff—bright on Drusniel’s knuckles and cheek, quickly dropping to shadow around Zaelar; thin cool window spill glints on the hourglass glass and instrument edges. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: strategic-map.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "—El conocimiento es poder. Si son tu enemigo, deberías entenderlos.")
prompt:Top-down desk detail in Zaelar’s study: a rough patrol sketch and compound layout on coarse paper with deliberately blurred, unreadable markings; a quill beside a stopped ink blot, a few small tokens used as markers, and a ribbon of sand spilled from an overturned hourglass across the desk grain. Warm oil-lamp light rakes across paper fibers, ink sheen, and glass edges, casting crisp token shadows; the surrounding shelves fall away into cool darkness with only faint blue window spill catching the rim of the hourglass. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight dust on lens, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: drusniel-unease.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La conversación se sentía mal —demasiadas preguntas específicas, demasiado interés en detalles tácticos— pero no podía articular por qué.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Doubt sharpening, brow furrowed; sweat and dust clinging from training, gaze tracking Zaelar like a threat he can’t name. Tight close-up on Drusniel’s face with the background melting into soft blur—hourglasses ticking, stacked books and instruments, the study’s clutter turning into shapes and glints. Warm lamp light strikes one side of his face in amber while the far side drops into cooler shadow, a faint blue rim from the window outlining his cheek and ear. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: walking-home-counting.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel continuó a casa, contando sus pasos mientras iba.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Exhausted focus, eyes down and distant, thumb tapping the count like a ritual against panic. Low tracking shot along bleak surface passages toward Umbra’kor: rough stone corridor opening to thin shafts of grey daylight, scattered gravel underfoot, cloak shifting with each step as he walks alone. Overcast daylight spills in from above as cold, flat illumination; dust in the air catches as pale streaks while shadows stay soft and heavy in alcoves. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in his steps, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
