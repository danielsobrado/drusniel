1. filename: tower-interior.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Cautious, alert; shoulders tight as he steps inside and scans the hall.
Environment: Tower entry hall lit by iron candle brackets, shelves crammed with old books in unreadable scripts, hourglasses everywhere with sand in white, black, red, and gold steadily falling. Warm candlelight flickers across paper edges and glass curvature; cold gray daylight leaking through high windows adds cool rim highlights and reveals dust motes drifting in thin shafts, while shadows pool deep with minimal bounce.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: zaelar-reveal.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Sus ojos capturaban la luz de las velas y la reflejaban de vuelta: violeta, cambiando hacia plata mientras descendía.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: measured calm, faint almost-gentle smile; descending with deliberate slowness. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Guarded suspicion, chin tilted up as he watches.
Environment: Tight spiral staircase, candle brackets throwing warm flicker across stone steps. Hourglasses on nearby shelves catch specular glints; candlelight backlights the descending figure and reflects as shifting highlights in the eyes while the stairwell behind stays dense and matte black.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: tea-for-two.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Dos tazas.")
prompt: Two teacups on a small table near the staircase, both still steaming; a simple tea service placed with careful precision.
Environment: Warm candlelight is the primary light, flickering orange across ceramic glaze and rising steam; reflections ripple across the dark tea surface while cold gray daylight spill adds a faint cool rim along the table edge. Condensation beads cling to the cup lip and catch as tiny highlights.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: hourglass-turned.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "—El tiempo es el único recurso que no puede recuperarse.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Long fingers steady, unhurried; flipping a nearby hourglass as red sand begins to fall again.
Environment: Extreme close-up on glass curvature and sand stream. Candle flame reflections warp through the hourglass body, warm halation blooming around the brightest highlights; individual grains catch and release tiny points of light as they pour, while surrounding shelves dissolve into soft blur.

5. filename: handshake-trap.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel se estiró y colocó su mano en la palma de Zaelar.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Fingers tense, wrist rigid; forcing himself to commit. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Still and open-palmed, too calm.
Environment: Tight shot at the tea table as their hands meet, pressure visible in knuckles and tendons. Candlelight is warm and low, carving contrast across fingers and catching tiny highlights in the eyes; hourglasses and unreadable books blur behind into soft bokeh while shadows pool beyond the table edge.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
