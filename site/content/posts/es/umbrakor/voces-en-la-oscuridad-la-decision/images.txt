1. filename: sneaking-past-study.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: tense focus, breathing controlled; dressed in dark practical clothes, moving like a shadow. Low-angle shot in the family compound corridor at the third hour past midnight as Drusniel slips past his father's study door, warm lamp light leaking under the threshold and striping the stone floor. Sparse cyan fungal clusters along the corridor add cold fill in the shadows, turning the hall into a warm-cool chiaroscuro of secrecy and routine. Canon EOS R5, 24mm f/2.8, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: surface-door.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "La manija estaba fría.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Knuckles tight, grip firm; pausing with his palm on the cold handle. Close-up of the service corridor door leading to the outer tunnels, its surface scarred and marked with faded warning symbols and protocols, a hairline crack in the stone beside the hinges pulling his eyes like a counting habit. Sparse cyan fungal light glances off worn metal and gritty stone; highlights catch rust texture and the curve of his fingers while everything beyond falls into tunnel-dark. Sony A7R IV, 50mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: stepping-out-gray.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El mundo de arriba.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Squinting into unfamiliar light, posture braced; stepping out with cautious determination. Wide shot from behind as Drusniel emerges from the tunnel mouth into a gray dawn, thick cloud cover pressing low over wet stone and gray trees with ash-colored leaves. Diffuse overcast daylight is the only light, flattening shadows and turning the world into cold tones; damp air hangs as a thin mist that softens distant hills. Canon EOS R5, 24mm f/1.4, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: looking-back-tunnel.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "No volvió a mirar atrás.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Shoulders set, gaze fixed forward; refusing the pull to look back. Medium-long shot on the hillside as he walks away from the nearly invisible tunnel entrance embedded in rock, the mouth a black cut in wet stone behind him. Overcast dawn light flattens the landscape into cold grays; atmospheric mist softens distant hills while the tunnel stays pure black with no detail, swallowing any hint of home. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/2.8, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: tower-horizon.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "De pie sola en una colina como un dedo señalando las nubes.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Still and intent, scanning; a subtle shift from doubt to determination. Long-lens landscape from a higher rise: Drusniel a small figure in the foreground with the gray hills unfolding ahead, and in the distance a dark stone tower of sharp angles standing alone on a hill like a finger pointing at the clouds. Overcast dawn is the only light, desaturating the world; the tower reads as a near-black silhouette against heavy gray sky, softened by atmospheric haze. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
