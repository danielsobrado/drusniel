## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel’s grief spikes and the air detonates outward, whipping smoke into a tight spiral. Loose papers and dust blast across the hall as torch flames bend sideways.
[00:03-00:05] The nearest assassins stagger and brace, boots grinding on stone. Their armor clicks as they recover and step forward through the pressure.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel’s breath catches; he pivots hard and runs into the haze toward the side passage, leaving the torches guttering behind him as the smoke swallows the frame.

Static wide shot letting the pressure wave fill the frame.
Audio: raw scream (no words), torch roar and sputter, paper slap, dust hiss, armor clink, boots scrape on stone, ragged breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
