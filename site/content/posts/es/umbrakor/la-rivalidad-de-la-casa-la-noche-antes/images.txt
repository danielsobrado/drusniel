1. filename: family-dinner.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father] drow with blueish ash skin color, Rare laugh lines breaking through the tactical mask, shoulders loosening for one evening. [Face_Reference: Mother] drow with blueish ash skin color, Quiet pride and careful calm as she watches the family finally breathe. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] drow with blueish ash skin color, Guarded posture with a brief, reluctant softening at the corners of her mouth. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Awkward, genuine laughter returning like a forgotten language. Family dinner inside the compound dining room: steaming bowls of spiced mushroom stew, crisp-skinned cave fish, warm bread torn by hand, a bottle of wine near the centerpiece; bioluminescent flowers arranged on the table while reinforced door latches and a few weapons hung by the doorway hint at the danger outside. Teal bioluminescent bloom-light rises from the table center as cool fill, while a few candles provide warm amber flicker that paints cheeks and catches on ceramic glaze; shadows stay soft on the carved stone walls. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: father-laughing.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Su padre se rio —realmente se rio, un sonido que Drusniel escuchaba quizás dos veces al año.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Father] drow with blueish ash skin color, Unguarded laughter, eyes creasing with warmth instead of calculation. Tight portrait across the dinner table: steam from the stew drifting between him and the camera, a torn piece of bread in his hand, the faint blur of his family beyond. Teal glow from the bioluminescent flowers underlights his jaw and knuckles, while candlelight adds warm amber highlights on his cheekbones and the rim of a cup; background falls into soft shadow. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: balcony-talk.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "La ciudad se extendía debajo de ellos, un entramado de senderos bioluminiscentes y edificios ensombrecidos.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Wary, exhausted focus, sensing her approach before she speaks. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] drow with blueish ash skin color, Neutral assessment hiding concern, weight balanced like she’s always ready to move. Two-shot on the balcony railing: the fungal glow of Umbra’kor districts spreads below like a bioluminescent lattice, stone balustrade cold under their hands, faint condensation in their breath. Cool blue-green city-glow rises from below as the main light, edging their profiles and turning the stone wet-sheen into thin specular lines; a small wall lantern behind them adds a weak warm rim on hair and shoulders. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in drifting haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: accusation.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Has estado yendo a la superficie. Te seguí dos veces antes de perder el rastro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] drow with blueish ash skin color, Professional cold focus, jaw set, accusation delivered like a verdict. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Guarded fear and defiance, throat tight, eyes refusing to drop. Over-shoulder confrontation on the balcony: Shyntara steps into his space and points, the city’s glow webbing the background while the railing divides them like a line he crossed. Blue-green glow from below carves hard edges along their cheeks; a warm lantern near the doorway throws a thin amber stripe across Shyntara’s finger and Drusniel’s collar, leaving the rest in heavy shadow. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare from the lantern, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: regret.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Se fue sin esperar respuesta.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Regret settling in, eyes distant, mouth held thin as he swallows words he didn’t say. Drusniel alone on the balcony after she leaves: hands gripping the stone railing, city glow pulsing below, the compound behind him quiet and sealed. Cool blue-green light from the city underlights his face and the stonework, while a faint warm spill from the doorway behind paints a soft amber edge on his shoulder and fingers; the rest dissolves into darkness. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
