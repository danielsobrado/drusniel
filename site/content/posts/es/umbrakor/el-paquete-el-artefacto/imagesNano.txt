1. filename: artifact-box.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: waiting with composed control, hands steady beside the tools. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: hollow exhaustion with wary focus, approaching like every step is a decision. Morning inside Zaelar's tower as grey light filters through shutters onto a worktable laid out with maps and travel provisions; at the center, a small ancient dark metal plate pulses faintly like a heartbeat while dust and candle soot cling to paper edges and wood grain. Cold window light stays flat and blue-grey; a single candle pools warm amber across the table, interactive highlights catching scuffs and grime in the plate's grooves. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: opening-box.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Pulsaba levemente, como un latido.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro close-up of the dark metal plate on the table: palm-sized geometric shape, etched symbols that seem to shift when viewed straight on, tiny scratches and grime packed into grooves; nearby map paper and tool metal blur at the edges of frame. The plate emits a faint cool pulse that paints thin blue-grey reflections on paper fibers; candlelight adds warm amber rim that reveals micro-scratches, interactive specular points popping on the sharpest edges. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, slight vignetting. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-touching.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel presionÃ³. Se concentrÃ³.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: face tense with concentration, breath held, thumb steady. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Expression: close and guiding, eyes fixed on the symbol, unreadable. Tight shot of Drusniel pressing his thumb to a specific symbol on the plate while Zaelar guides from the side, maps and provisions scattered around the worktable. Candlelight and grey shuttered daylight mix across hands, interactive warm highlights catching pores and knuckle ridges while cold fill keeps the room edges flat. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: weight-of-object.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El mundo se volviÃ³ silencioso.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: eyes widening and breath caught as the effect hits, shoulders tightening like his body no longer recognizes itself. Reaction portrait with the plate still under his thumb on the table and Zaelar blurred in the background watching intently. Candlelight provides low warm key from below, hard shadows under cheekbones; cold shuttered daylight adds thin blue-grey fill that makes the room feel suddenly empty, interactive highlights barely catching on glass grit. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: hiding-artifact.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel guardÃ³ el artefacto en su paquete.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: face set with determined numbness, hands precise as he packs without looking back. Medium shot of Drusniel sliding the plate into a protective pouch and tucking it into his travel pack, fingers brushing the Vrinn dagger at his belt; straps and worn fabric fill the frame, pulse barely visible through the pouch seam. Candlelight adds warm amber to stitching and leather grain; cold shuttered daylight keeps the background flat and grey, smoke haze softening edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
