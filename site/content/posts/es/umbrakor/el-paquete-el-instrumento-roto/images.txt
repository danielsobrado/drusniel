1. filename: burnt-tower.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Photorealistic, chest heaving from the climb; hollow stare fixed on the damage, posture barely held upright. From the edge of the treeline at dawn, Drusniel looks across a forest clearing toward Zaelar's stone tower: lower walls blackened with scorch marks, door hanging crooked on broken hinges, an annex collapsed with beams still smoking; wet grass trampled and ash drifting through cold air. Pale sunrise cuts through thin smoke, cool highlights catching damp stone while warmer edges glow along the smoke and dew. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: zaelar-singed.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El viejo mago apareció en el umbral roto.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] Photorealistic, controlled relief that never fully softens; pale eyes sharp and calculating, robe hem singed, fresh cut along his cheek, ash smeared on one sleeve. Zaelar stands in the shattered doorway framed by splintered wood and cracked stone as smoke drifts behind him from the ruined annex and the clearing sits in soft blur. Cold dawn backlight silhouettes drifting smoke, while a single interior candle or lantern throws warm amber up onto his jawline and the edge of his cut with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, natural skin texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shared-enemy.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las marcas de quemadura en las paredes. La puerta rota. El edificio colapsado.")
prompt:Photorealistic close detail of the tower damage: black scorch patterns on rough stone, splintered doorframe, shattered glass scattered on the threshold, and a collapsed beam still releasing thin smoke. Hard dawn side light rakes across soot and wet grit, turning ash flecks into bright points while the deepest burn stays matte and dead. Sony A7R IV 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, slight vignetting. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: allies-handshake.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El viejo mago extendió la mano, lo estabilizó con una mano en su hombro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Zaelar] Photorealistic, intent and steady; grip firm on the shoulder, gesture almost fatherly but controlling. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Hollow exhaustion with grief crystallizing into resolve; eyes hardening, posture barely held upright. Tight two-shot at the ruined threshold as Zaelar steadies Drusniel and draws him inside, smoke curling through the broken doorway while scorched stone and the collapsed annex blur behind. Cool dawn light outlines their profiles, while warm interior lantern spill adds amber to knuckles and cheekbones with subtle halation. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: entering-ruin.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel lo siguió a través de la puerta rota. Vidrio crujió bajo sus pies. Papeles dispersos por el suelo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Photorealistic, tense profile and shallow breathing; eyes scanning damage while he steps carefully. [Face_Reference: Zaelar] Composed, already moving ahead, keeping Drusniel inside his orbit. Interior of the violated study as Drusniel steps over shattered glass and papers and maps lie scattered (no readable text), instruments toppled, shelves disturbed; Zaelar leads him deeper into the room while smoke haze hangs low. A cold shaft of dawn light cuts through dust and smoke, and a single candle fights back with weak warm glow that catches floating motes and the edge of broken glass. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around the candle, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
