1. filename: header.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: wary focus at the edge of a decision, posture braced against the wrongness ahead. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]. Expression: controlled distance, eyes fixed on the boundary. Wide shot at a cliff edge as Drusniel faces the barrier where the air looks like oily glass and colors shift at the line; faint red light and black rock hints show beyond, wind tugging at cloaks and grass. Overcast daylight keeps this side cold and grey; the boundary throws purple-green iridescent sheen that slides across mist and damp stone, interactive highlights moving like liquid on the surface. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: mid-01.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "ActivÃ³ la placa.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: expression tightening as the void sensation hits, breath caught, thumb pressing with precision. Medium-close shot of him activating the Null plate in his palm as the air ahead thickens like oil and his first step presses into the barrier; cold grey surface light falls behind while red-black glow bleeds through in front. The plate's faint cool pulse adds thin reflections on fingers; boundary sheen ripples across sleeve fabric, interactive highlights sliding as the surface shifts. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur at the barrier edge. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: mid-02.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "CreÃ³ una bolsa alrededor de su cara.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: jaw clenched and eyes wide with cold shock, panic forced down into function. Underwater in the Mar de Pesadilla: near-total darkness with suspended particulate as he kicks upward, compressing trapped surface air into a thin bubble around his mouth and nose; pack straps and fabric pull heavy in the current. Only a weak grey smear above provides light; bubbles catch tiny highlights while the water eats color into cold contrast and deep blacks. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, subtle motion blur in bubbles. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: mid-03.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Una de ellas se volviÃ³ hacia Ã©l.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: refusing to look down, muscles straining as he kicks toward the lighter water above. Underwater perspective angled downward: Drusniel drives upward through murk while an enormous indistinct shape shifts in the depths below, a single distant glint hinting at a colossal eye; clothing and straps pull in the current. Light is minimal, only grey from above; deep black swallows the lower frame, leaving the glint as the only hard point, interactive reflections trembling on bubbles. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: mid-04.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel yaciÃ³ sobre las rocas, jadeando, temblando, mirando un cielo del color de sangre vieja.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression: exhausted and stunned, coughing water, shaking hard as breath returns. Shoreline on black volcanic rock as he collapses on the stones, wet fabric clinging and dripping; behind him the sea rolls in rhythmic breathing-like swells, and above him the sky is deep red like old blood. Diffuse red sky light provides flat illumination; wet rock and skin catch sharp specular sheen and throw small reflections into shadow, with tiny droplets sparkling on fabric threads. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed, slight water droplets on lens. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
