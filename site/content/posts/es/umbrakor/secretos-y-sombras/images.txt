1. filename: forest-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Anxious determination, jaw tight, glancing back over shoulder. Dark hooded travel cloak, damp at the hem. Slipping through twisted black trees in the dark forests of Umbra'kor at first light, pale dawn threading through gnarled branches above, damp ground carpeted with luminous moss and low fog curling around his boots. Bioluminescent fungi on tree trunks cast faint teal sidelight onto his cheekbone and collar, fog diffusing the glow into soft halos. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2 Kodak Portra 400, slight motion blur on trailing cloak edge. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: failing-magic.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "pero era como tratar de agarrar humo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Sweat on brow, eyes squeezed shut in concentration, veins visible at temple. [Face_Reference: Annariel] Holding a small tongue of flame over his open palm, watching Drusniel with patient concern. Two young drow face each other in a hidden grove at night, Drusniel straining to pierce an illusion that keeps dissolving. Flickering firelight from Annariel's palm casts warm orange uplight on both faces and the rough bark behind them, deep forest darkness pressing in from all sides. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, shallow depth of field, sweat droplet catching light. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mind-reading-success.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "A veces, capturaba destellos - una ráfaga de emoción, una imagen a medio formar - pero era como tratar de agarrar humo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes narrowed with fierce focus, one hand raised palm-forward. [Face_Reference: Annariel] Standing opposite, maintaining a complex shimmer of illusory light between his fingers, tension in his shoulders. Two drow locked in psychic concentration across a small clearing, postures rigid with effort. Low campfire embers between them cast faint orange underglow on their chins and hands, the illusion itself throwing unstable pale violet flickers across their faces. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, background dissolved to dark bokeh. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: zaelar-rumor.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "\"Escuché un rumor ayer,\" dijo Annariel, su voz baja. \"Sobre Wyrmreach.\"")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Alert ears raised, leaning in to listen, curiosity breaking through fatigue. [Face_Reference: Annariel] Leaning close, voice low, conspiratorial expression. Two young drow seated against a knotted tree trunk in a moonlit grove, mist threading through undergrowth around them. Cool blue-white moonlight filtering through canopy above, catching the edges of their ears and hair, bioluminescent moss on the tree trunk casting faint teal ambient on their shoulders. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, natural grain, one leaf slightly out of focus in foreground. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: father-disappointment.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "su padre lo fijó con una mirada penetrante.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes lowered to plate, uneasy posture, shoulders drawn in. [Face_Reference: Father] Hard assessing stare across the table, jaw set. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] Seated nearby, restrained contempt in her expression, arms crossed. Family dinner in the great hall of a drow estate, carved stone walls and dark wood furnishings. Warm candlelight from iron candelabras on the table casting golden light upward onto faces and reflecting off polished stone, deep shadows pooling in the corners of the hall. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, visible wax drip on nearest candle. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
