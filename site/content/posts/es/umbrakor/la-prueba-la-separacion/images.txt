1. filename: separation-platform.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Frozen shock, mouth slightly open, eyes searching. Standing motionless on polished obsidian floor. [Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Being pulled toward a carved dark wooden door, reaching back. Top-down angle of a trial platform area as successful candidates file toward one door and failed candidates shuffle toward the opposite corridor, Drusniel isolated in the center as the crowd splits around him. Purple bioluminescent fungi on the cavern ceiling cast cold violet downlight onto the polished obsidian floor, harsh shadows radiating from each figure. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, slight chromatic aberration at frame edges. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: annariel-look-back.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Su expresión decía todo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Tight panic, disbelief, tears catching light at the corners of his eyes, looking back over his shoulder. Being pulled toward the carved training door by a mage's grip on his arm. Drusniel visible in the distance behind him, standing alone and helpless on the obsidian floor. Purple bioluminescent light from ceiling fungi catches the moisture at Annariel's eyes and the pale edge of his jaw, the dark doorway yawning behind him. Canon EOS R5 135mm f/2 Kodak Portra 400, compressed perspective, background figures soft. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shame-hall.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Miles de nombres.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Rigid posture, eyes fixed forward, jaw clenched. Walking alone through a narrow obsidian corridor carved floor-to-ceiling with thousands of names, some letters worn smooth with centuries of age, others freshly cut and pale against the dark stone. Cold teal bioluminescent fungi growing in thin lines along the corridor seams cast low sidelight onto the carved letters, shrinking the space. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, visible dust motes in the fungal light. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: the-clerk.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Esperen aquí.")
prompt:Top-down desk shot of a gray-robed drow scribe writing in a thick ledger with a quill, ink dark and glossy on rough yellowed paper, a chipped ceramic ink pot and brass sand shaker nearby. Drusniel stands across the desk, out of focus. Harsh single lamplight from an oil lamp on the desk casting strong downward shadows across the ledger pages and the scribe's knuckles, everything beyond the desk edge falling to near-black. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, ink smudge visible on scribe's finger. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: waiting-bench.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Ninguno se miraba.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Seated on a cold stone bench, eyes closed, jaw tight. Failed candidates around him on similar benches: one crying quietly with head in hands, one staring blankly at their own palms, an older drow with hollow vacant eyes. None looking at each other. Small waiting chamber with low obsidian ceiling and gray-robed scribes at a table in the background. Dim overhead bioluminescent glow casting flat pale light downward, heavy silence made visible by the rigid stillness of every figure. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2 Kodak Portra 400, slight underexposure. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
