1. filename: separation-platform.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Frozen shock, mouth slightly open, eyes searching the crowd. Standing motionless on polished obsidian. [Face_Reference: Annariel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Being pulled toward a carved wooden door, arm reaching back. Top-down angle of a trial platform as successful candidates file toward one door and failed ones shuffle toward the opposite corridor, Drusniel isolated in the center as the crowd splits. Purple bioluminescent fungi on the cavern ceiling cast cold violet downlight onto the mirror-polished obsidian floor, each figure's shadow radiates sharply outward on the reflective surface. Shadows tinged deep violet at their edges where fungal light meets obsidian darkness. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, slight chromatic aberration at frame edge. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: annariel-look-back.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Su expresión decía todo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Tight panic, disbelief, tears catching purple light at eye corners. Looking back over shoulder while being pulled by a mage's grip toward the carved training door. Drusniel visible in the distance behind, standing alone on obsidian. Purple bioluminescent ceiling light catches the moisture at Annariel's eyes as interactive specular highlight, reflects off the wet edge of his jaw. The dark doorway behind him swallows all detail. Shadows under his chin tinged violet from the overhead fungi. Sony A7R V 135mm f/1.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, compressed perspective, background dissolves soft. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: shame-hall.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Miles de nombres.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Rigid posture, eyes fixed forward, jaw clenched. Walking alone through a narrow obsidian corridor carved floor-to-ceiling with thousands of names. Some letters worn smooth with age, others freshly cut and pale against dark stone. Cold teal bioluminescent fungi growing in thin seam lines along the corridor cast low sidelight onto the carved letters, the light reflects off the smoother worn names differently than the rough fresh cuts creating varied interactive highlights. Corridor compresses to vanishing point ahead. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, visible dust motes in fungal light. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-clerk.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Esperen aquí.")
prompt:Top-down desk shot. Gray-robed drow scribe writing in a thick ledger with a quill, ink dark and glossy on rough yellowed paper. Chipped ceramic ink pot and brass sand shaker nearby. Drusniel stands across the desk out of focus. Harsh single oil lamp on desk casts strong downward light onto the ledger pages and the scribe's knuckles, the wet ink line reflects the lamplight as a bright interactive streak. Everything beyond desk edge falls to near-black. Ink smudge on scribe's index finger. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, warm tone shift from lamp. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: waiting-bench.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Ninguno se miraba.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Seated on cold stone bench, eyes closed, jaw tight. Failed candidates on similar benches around him: one crying with head in hands, one staring at palms, an older drow with hollow eyes. None looking at each other. Small waiting chamber with low obsidian ceiling. Dim overhead bioluminescent glow casts flat pale downlight, reflecting off the polished bench surfaces as faint interactive highlight. Heavy stillness, every figure rigid. Shadows beneath benches tinged cold teal. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8 GM, Kodak Portra 400, slight underexposure, natural skin pores. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
