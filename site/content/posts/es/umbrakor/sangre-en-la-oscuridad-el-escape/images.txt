1. filename: tunnel-run.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Hyperfocused fear, breath ragged, listening to footsteps like a metronome closing in. Drusniel sprints through a claustrophobic maze of servant passages and storage corridors, one hand brushing the stone for direction as ventilation grates and old fittings flash by; smoke haze lingers and pursuit echoes around the bends behind him. A distant torch flicker and occasional lantern spill provide the only warm light, breaking into amber streaks through haze; cold blue-green fungal stains in the stone add thin rim highlights along condensation and floor grit. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: air-push-success.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El empuje de aire alcanzó al atacante en el centro de masa.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Calm forced through panic, eyes narrowed in concentration as he spends what little control he has. In a narrow corridor beside a ventilation grate, Drusniel braces and releases a compressed burst of air at point-blank range, slamming a masked assassin backward into a second attacker; smoke and dust snap sideways in a sharp pressure wave. Warm torch/lantern flicker glints on blade edges and wet stone while the smoke turns into streaks and bands; cold fungal rim light traces the grate and wall edges. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: nosebleed.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Sangre goteaba de su nariz, tibia contra su labio superior.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Exhaustion and dizziness fighting with survival, eyes glassy at the edges as he forces himself forward. Close-up mid-run as he wipes fresh blood from his nose with a shaking hand, breath tearing, corridor walls blurring into stone and shadow behind him. Torchlight flicker catches wet blood sheen and sweat on his knuckles; the rest falls into smoky darkness with only occasional cold rim highlights from fungal stains on the wall. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: rusty-door.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El mecanismo antiguo cedió: óxido y polvo y décadas de abandono rindiéndose al impulso desesperado.")
prompt:Hidden servant door in a storage corridor bursts inward under Drusniel’s impact: ancient metal fittings bend, rust flakes and dust plume into the air, the stone frame cracking where the mechanism fails; beyond is the darker outer tunnel system swallowing light. Warm torchlight behind him paints amber highlights across rust texture and airborne dust; the tunnel beyond remains cold and nearly black, creating a hard contrast at the doorway edge. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in dust plume, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: hiding-place.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Luego se arrastró hasta una grieta apenas lo suficientemente grande para sostenerlo y presionó su espalda contra la piedra fría.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Terror held perfectly still, tears and blood mixing as he listens for the next footstep. Cramped rock crevice deep in the outer tunnels: Drusniel wedged inside with knees pulled tight, back pressed to cold stone, hands smeared with fresh nosebleed blood as he tries not to breathe too loud. Near-total darkness—only a faint reflected glimmer from distant torchlight and wet stone gives shape, creating tiny specular points on condensation and leaving his face mostly swallowed by shadow. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, very low light, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
