1. filename: tunnel-run.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Hyperfocused fear, breath ragged; sprinting with one hand brushing the stone for bearings as footsteps echo behind. Claustrophobic servant passages and storage corridors with ventilation grates and old fittings, smoke haze lingering, condensation on stone. Distant torch flicker and occasional lantern spill break into amber streaks through haze; cold blue-green fungal stains add thin rim highlights along wet stone and floor grit, specular glints sliding as he passes. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: air-push-success.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El empuje de aire alcanzó al atacante en el centro de masa.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Calm forced through panic, eyes narrowed; braced and releasing a compressed burst from an outstretched palm. Narrow corridor beside a ventilation grate as the air-push slams a masked assassin backward into a second attacker, smoke and dust snapping sideways in a sharp pressure wave. Warm torch/lantern flicker glints on blade edges and wet stone; cold fungal rim light traces the grate and wall edges, interactive highlights trembling in the smoke bands. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: nosebleed.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Sangre goteaba de su nariz, tibia contra su labio superior.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Exhaustion and dizziness fighting with survival; wiping fresh blood from his nose with a shaking hand mid-run. Corridor walls blur into stone and shadow behind him as breath tears. Torchlight flicker catches wet blood sheen and sweat on knuckles; occasional cold rim from fungal stains outlines cheek and fingers, background falling into smoky darkness. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: rusty-door.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El mecanismo antiguo cedió: óxido y polvo y décadas de abandono rindiéndose al impulso desesperado.")
prompt:Hidden servant door bursts inward under impact: ancient metal fittings bend, rust flakes and dust plume into the air, stone frame cracking where the mechanism fails; beyond is the darker outer tunnel system swallowing light. Warm torchlight behind paints amber highlights across rust texture and airborne dust; the tunnel beyond stays cold and nearly black, a hard contrast at the doorway edge with specular grit flashes as particles tumble. Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in dust plume, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: hiding-place.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Luego se arrastró hasta una grieta apenas lo suficientemente grande para sostenerlo y presionó su espalda contra la piedra fría.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Terror held perfectly still, tears and blood mixing; wedged inside with knees pulled tight, trying not to breathe. Cramped rock crevice deep in the outer tunnels, hands smeared with fresh nosebleed blood, wet stone beading with condensation. Near-total darkness with only faint reflected glimmer from distant torchlight; tiny specular points sparkle on moisture and grit, leaving most of his face swallowed by shadow. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, very low light, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
