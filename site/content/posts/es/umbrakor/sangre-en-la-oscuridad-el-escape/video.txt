## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel hits the hidden door at full speed. The mechanism groans and rust bursts into the air in a choking cloud.
[00:03-00:05] The fittings snap and the door swings inward. He stumbles through into cold darkness, hands catching the stone to keep from falling.
[00:05-00:08] Boots pound closer behind him; gear clatters in the corridor. Drusniel scrambles upright and runs deeper into the tunnel maze as the dust cloud rolls after him.

Handheld push-through following Drusniel through the doorway into darkness.
Audio: metal groan, rust crunch, dust cough, boot impacts, gear clatter, ragged breathing, fabric scrape on stone. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
