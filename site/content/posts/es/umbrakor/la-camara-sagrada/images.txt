prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Tense stillness, eyes tracing wall cracks, thin ceremonial tunic. [Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Crouching beside him, fingers drumming against his knee. Two young drow set apart from a dozen praying candidates in a sacred antechamber carved from living rock.
