## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Servants rush through the corridor in opposite directions, trays and rolled reports jolting in their hands. Lantern and fungal light throw restless shadows that slide across carved stone.
[00:03-00:05] Drusniel slips in through the service entrance and stops, taking in the controlled panic. A sharp hand gesture redirects a servant, relief flashing and then disappearing as voices rise deeper in the hall.
[00:05-00:08] A raised voice echoes from the study. The corridor flow tightens as people squeeze past each other, and Drusniel turns toward the sound, jaw setting before he moves.

Slow tracking shot following Drusniel from the service entrance into the corridor flow.
Audio: hurried footsteps on stone, cloth rustle, tray clink, distant muffled shouting, lantern chain rattle, faint wet hum of bioluminescent fungi. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
