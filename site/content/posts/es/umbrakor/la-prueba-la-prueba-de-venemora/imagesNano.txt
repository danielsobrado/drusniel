1. filename: trial-chamber-reveal.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Standing at the edge of the candidate line, eyes tracing column cracks. [Face_Reference: Annariel]. Beside him, shoulders forced back, faking confidence. Low-angle wide shot inside the trial chamber. Towering obsidian columns rise into a ceiling lost in darkness. Bioluminescent fungi in pale clusters cast bruised purple light across the space, the light refracts through airborne moisture and creates a violet haze that thickens with height, the obsidian column surfaces reflect distorted purple highlights that shift as the viewer's angle changes, deep shadows pool between columns where the fungal light cannot reach. A circular black stone platform beneath a wing-shaped altar at the chamber's heart. Candidates dwarfed. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8, Kodak Portra 400, barrel distortion at edges, dust particles caught in the purple light. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: annariel-success.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Habían logrado lo imposible.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel]. Tears running down his face, legs unsteady as he rises from the platform. Relief and disbelief cracking through his composure. Close portrait. Purple bioluminescent fungal light from wall clusters catches each tear track and turns them into thin violet lines on his cheeks, the wet skin reflects the purple glow with higher intensity than dry skin around it creating interactive highlights that trace his bone structure, the wing-shaped altar casts a shadow across his shoulder that transitions from deep purple to black. Robed mages blurred behind him writing on slate. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM, Cinestill 800T, halation blooms around the brightest fungal clusters, skin wet with tears. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-platform.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Alcanza.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Kneeling on the warm stone, eyes shut tight, one hand reaching upward toward unseen blessing. Tendons taut in neck and forearm, sweat on skin. Medium shot on the circular black platform. Purple bioluminescent light from the chamber walls hits his reaching hand from multiple angles and wraps around the tendons with soft violet fill, sweat on his skin catches the purple glow and creates scattered specular points across his forearm, the warm platform stone beneath him radiates a faint thermal shimmer visible against the colder obsidian floor surrounding it. Wing-shaped altar looms above. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM, Cinestill 800T, slightly underexposed, grain visible in shadows. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-void-feeling.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Como cicatriz sobre una amputación.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes snapping open into panic, hands numb on the stone, mouth slightly parted. Tight portrait on the platform as realization hits. The purple bioluminescent light from fungal clusters above falls directly onto his upturned face and creates harsh violet shadows in his eye sockets and under his jaw, the obsidian platform reflects a secondary purple glow upward that fills the shadows with a bruised undertone, robed mages in the background already looking past him cast long indifferent shadows across the chamber floor. Vast uncaring space. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, unflattering overhead angle. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: annariel-horror.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Porque Annariel sabía.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel]. Standing with successful candidates near the far wall, face ash-pale with pure horror, mouth open. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Stepping away from the platform toward the exit, rigid posture, not looking back. Long-lens compressed shot across the full width of the chamber. Purple bioluminescent light fills the space unevenly, brighter near the wall clusters where Annariel stands creating violet rim light on his horrified face, dimmer in the middle distance where robed mages move between the two friends, darkest near the exit where Drusniel walks into shadow. The distance between them dominates the composition. Sony A7R V 135mm f/2 GM, Kodak Portra 400, compressed perspective, both faces readable despite distance. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
