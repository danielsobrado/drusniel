1. filename: trial-chamber-reveal.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Standing at the edge of the candidate line, eyes tracing column cracks. [Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Beside him, shoulders back, faking confidence. Low-angle wide shot inside the trial chamber, towering obsidian columns rising into a ceiling lost in darkness, bioluminescent fungi casting bruised purple light across the space. A circular black stone platform beneath a wing-shaped altar at the chamber's heart. Candidates dwarfed by the architecture. Sony A7R IV 16mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, barrel distortion at edges, dust in the air. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: annariel-success.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Habían logrado lo imposible.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Tears running down his face, legs unsteady, rising from the platform. Relief and disbelief cracking through his composure. Close portrait in purple fungal light, robed mages blurred behind him writing on slate tablets. The altar's wing shape casts a shadow across his shoulder. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, halation around the purple light sources, skin wet with tears. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drusniel-platform.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Alcanza.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Kneeling on the warm stone, eyes shut tight, one hand reaching upward toward the unseen blessing. Tendons taut in his neck and forearm. Medium shot, cold obsidian floor surrounding the platform, the wing-shaped altar looming above him. Purple fungal light catches sweat on his skin. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, slightly underexposed, grain visible in the shadows. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: the-void-feeling.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Como cicatriz sobre una amputación.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Eyes snapping open into panic, hands numb on the stone, mouth slightly parted. Tight portrait on the platform as realization hits. Robed mages in the background already looking past him, indifferent. The chamber vast and uncaring around him. Low purple bioluminescent light and deep shadows cutting across his face. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, unflattering angle. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: annariel-horror.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Porque Annariel sabía.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Annariel] drow with blueish ash skin color, Standing with successful candidates near the far wall, face ash-pale with pure horror, mouth open. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Stepping away from the platform toward the exit, rigid posture, not looking back. Long-lens shot across the chamber, robed mages between them, oppressive purple light flattening depth. The distance between the two friends fills the frame. Canon EOS R5 135mm f/2 Kodak Portra 400, compressed perspective, both faces readable despite the distance. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
