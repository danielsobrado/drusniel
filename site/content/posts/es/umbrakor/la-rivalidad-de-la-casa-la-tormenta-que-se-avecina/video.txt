## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The candle flame gutters and leans as the air around Drusniel’s fist tightens. Dust motes lift off the desk in slow spirals, drawn toward his knuckles.
[00:03-00:05] The swirl intensifies into a tight helix. Loose papers flutter and a hanging cord trembles; the oil-lamp glass gives a faint rattle as Drusniel’s fingers clamp harder.
[00:05-00:08] He forces a controlled exhale and loosens his grip by a fraction. The helix collapses into drifting dust again, the flame steadies, and the room returns to heavy silence—only the last few motes still spinning as if reluctant to stop.

Slow push-in from the drifting dust to the clenched fist.
Audio: candle crackle, paper rustle, faint low hum synced to the motion, fabric creak, one sharp inhale and a slow exhale, distant house quiet. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
