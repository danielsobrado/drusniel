1. filename: library-stacks.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Absorbed and cautious, fingers tracing spines he cannot read. [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Methodical focus, arranging hourglasses and notes with obsessive precision. Wide view of a circular library chamber at the tower's heart: floor-to-ceiling shelves packed with ancient leather-bound volumes, dust motes suspended in warm lamplight, and a central reading table stacked with loose pages and translations. One oil lamp and scattered candles are the primary light, warm amber pooling on paper fibers and glass while the shelves fall away into deep shadow. Canon EOS R5, 24mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: misfiled-note.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel se movió hacia la mesa.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Tense focus, scanning fast; shoulders hunched over the evidence. Close shot of Zaelar's obsessively organized research notes spread across a side table: diagrams, measurements, and timelines laid out with surgical precision beside a brittle ancient book cracked open. Warm lamplight is the only strong illumination, catching ink sheen and paper grain; dust and preservation oil haze soften the far shelves into darkness. Sony A7R IV, 50mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: name-on-list.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Un nombre captó su atención.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Throat gone dry, expression flattened into shock; fingers gripping paper hard enough to crease it. Medium close portrait of Drusniel holding a single page pulled from Zaelar's notes, his gaze locked on a line of cramped handwriting while the surrounding shelves blur behind; any writing remains unreadable texture, but the reaction is unmistakable. Warm candlelight catches the edge of the page and the moisture at his lower eyelid; shadows stay deep around the jaw and neck. Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: zaelar-tea.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Se fue. La puerta se cerró con un suave clic.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Zaelar]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Unhurried, leaving without looking back. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Frozen in place, still staring at the page. Wide interior of the circular library as Zaelar exits through a heavy door, his figure receding into shadow while Drusniel remains near the table, alone among towering shelves. One oil lamp casts a small pool of warm light and long shelf shadows; the closed door makes the silence feel sealed and deliberate. Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/1.4, Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: suspicion-begins.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Guardó la página en su manga y continuó leyendo.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color, . Wary determination replacing shock, jaw set; hiding the page in his sleeve while he forces himself to keep reading. Intimate reading-table scene beneath a low oil lamp: an ancient brittle book open to unfamiliar symbols, stacks of translations and scraps arranged around it, hourglass glass catching faint highlights in the background. Warm lamp light pools on paper edges and knuckles; the rest of the circular chamber drops into deep shadow with dust motes barely visible. Sony A7R IV, 50mm f/1.4, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
