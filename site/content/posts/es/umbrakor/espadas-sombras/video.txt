## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Shyntara's blade rests against Drusniel's throat. Neither moves. His chest heaves. A bead of sweat rolls down his jaw and catches the dim gray light. Her eyes hold his without blinking. Mist drifts slowly between bamboo stalks behind them.
[00:03-00:06] She withdraws the blade in a single clean motion. The steel edge flashes as it catches the canopy light. Drusniel exhales hard, shoulders dropping. Shyntara sheathes the weapon with a decisive click. She speaks, close to his face, her breath visible in the cool air.
[00:06-00:08] She turns and walks away between the bamboo stalks. Mist closes behind her. Drusniel stands alone, chest still heaving, hand rising slowly to touch his throat where the blade was.

Locked-off medium shot, eye level, shallow depth of field.
Audio: bamboo creaking in wind, dripping condensation, heavy breathing, steel sliding into sheath. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
