1. filename: header.png
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Coiled tension, dark drow-forged blade held low, scanning for openings. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] Predatory calm, alabaster hair stark against the gloom, blade raised. Two drow siblings circle each other on damp ground in a misty bamboo grove, stalks rising like a cage around them. Sparse gray light filtering through the canopy, mist clinging to the earth. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, slight vignetting at corners. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: mid-01.png
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Siempre justo fuera de alcance. Siempre un paso por delante.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Flowing around an attack with effortless precision, alabaster hair whipping through dark air. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Straining forward with clenched teeth, trembling arms, blade cutting empty space. Dynamic mid-fight shot in the bamboo grove, blades catching thin gray highlights, mist swirling from their movement. Sony A7R IV 70mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, slight motion blur on hair and blade edges. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: mid-02.png
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Alzó los ojos, encontrando una mirada tan gélida e implacable como los ríos subterráneos de su tierra natal.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Shyntara] Cold blade pressed to Drusniel's throat, calm and implacable, perfect posture, not a hair displaced. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Frozen, wide eyes, pulse visible in his neck. Close two-shot, cold metal edge catching what little gray light filters through bamboo. Mist and bamboo silhouettes blurred behind them. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, breath visible in cool air. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: mid-03.png
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Nunca demostraría su valor ante su familia.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Glaring with frustration and wounded pride, blade lowered. [Face_Reference: Shyntara] Speaking with cold certainty, weapon sheathed. Post-spar confrontation in the bamboo grove, tension visible in their hands and shoulders. Damp bamboo leaves on the ground, fog threading between stalks. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, overcast diffused light, dirt on clothing visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: mid-04.png
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel tocó la empuñadura de su espada.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Turned partly away, one hand gripping sword hilt, jaw working in silence. Shyntara's silhouette already dissolving between bamboo stalks in the background mist. Shallow depth of field, bamboo framing the shot on both sides, gray light fading. The grove feels emptier without her. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain and slight halation on the mist. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
