1. filename: flanking-maneuver.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Grim endurance, eyes forward, forcing pace despite pain; one hand keeping the pack close. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Breath hard, scanning side to side, fear sharpening into focus. Wide view down the dirt road as they push forward under late-afternoon sun; on both sides, vague silhouettes keep pace just inside the treeline, never fully stepping into the open, dappled light catching a blade hilt and a moving shoulder before it vanishes again. Warm low sun slices through branches and turns road dust into floating gold while the empty space ahead stays too quiet. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: organized-threat.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Se separaron en la última bifurcación: dos en el camino, dos a través de los árboles.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Eyes wide with realization, sweat on the brow, pointing sharply toward both sides of the road as he calls it out. [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Listening beside him with a grim controlled stare, already calculating options. Medium shot on the road framed by treeline where movement keeps slipping out of sight, shadows shifting between trunks in time with their pace, dust rising around boots and packs. Warm afternoon sun is low and directional, casting hard slats of light across faces and hands, while the forest edge stays darker and cooler, swallowing details. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: beacon-fire.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Pero no solo estaba apuntando.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Cold realization settling, grip firm, holding the cube like a burden he can't drop. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Fear breaking through, recoiling half a step, watching the glow build. Dulint holds the dark metal cube in both hands as its shifting geometric seams pulse brighter, the cold blue-white light flaring upward in a harsh vertical spill that reads like a signal visible for miles, catching dust motes and turning the air around their boots pale and unreal. The cube glow is the dominant diegetic light, throwing cold highlights onto knuckles and leather while the surrounding forest falls into deeper shadow by contrast. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: indifferent-hum.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El cubo zumbó.")
prompt: Macro close-up of the cube's perfect dark geometry in rough travel-worn hands, fine seams and shifting carvings lit from within by sterile cold blue-white glow; tiny grains of road dust tremble against the metal as if from a low vibration, indifferent and mechanical. The cube glow is the only strong light, creating crisp cold highlights on metal edges and leaving everything beyond the hands to fall into soft shadow. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 macro Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: breaking-into-run.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Detrás de ellos, los seguidores empezaron a correr.")
prompt: Telephoto view down the road as the followers finally break into a run out of the distance, cloaks snapping and armor shifting under fabric, weapons drawn and steel glinting in the low sun; dust rises around their boots and the gap is visibly closing, treeline blurring on both sides like a corridor. Low sun backlights the runners, turning dust into a glowing haze and flashing highlights across moving steel, while the road between hunter and prey stretches thin and exposed. Canon EOS R5 200mm f/4.0 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight atmospheric blur. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
