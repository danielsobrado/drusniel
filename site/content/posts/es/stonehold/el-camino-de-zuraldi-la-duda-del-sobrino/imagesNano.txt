1. filename: confrontation-on-road.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Anger and fear tangled, grip iron-hard on Dulint's forearm; eyes narrowed, calculating. [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Exhaustion breaking through control, jaw tight. Balin halts Dulint mid-stride and forces the argument into the open.
Environment: Uneven gravel road between gray hills, dust swirling around boots and pack straps, silence behind them heavy and watched. Late-afternoon sun is low and warm, casting long shadows and carving hard light on knuckles and cracked leather; valley walls cut the light into alternating bands of sun and shade. Dust scatters sunlight into a warm beige haze.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: finding-the-cube-flashback.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Yo fui quien lo sacÃ³ del estrato")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Triumphant grin through rock dust, eyes bright with reckless pride, arm buried in shadow. Flashback: he reaches into a seam where the wall geometry looks wrong and pulls the perfect dark cube free.
Environment: Old mine tunnel, stale dust and ozone in the air. Single torch is the only light, warm orange flicker catching airborne grit and turning stone texture sharp; the gap behind his arm stays unnaturally dark, absorbing the torch glow. Basalt-like stone shows chipped edges and ancient mortar seams; torch halation blooms slightly.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: xandor-hope.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Conozco un contacto")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Dulint]D&D dwarf, . Desperate hope forced into a plan, eyes fixed on the road ahead; hand lifted to point. [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Skeptical tension, still angry, but listening. Dulint points toward Riverhold as the shadows swallow the road.
Environment: Road hooks left and disappears between rising hills, shadows lengthening into grey pools; dust hangs in the air. Low sun throws warm amber from the side, catching dust as glittering points while the far side of bodies falls into deep shade. Warm light reflects off buckles and leather straps; cool shadow fill desaturates the valley.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: tagged-realization.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Estamos marcados.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Balin]D&D dwarf, . Horror draining his face, eyes locked past Dulint; hand hovering near his knife without drawing it. Tight portrait as the realization lands.
Environment: Valley shade cools the scene; a thin warm rim from the remaining sun catches the edge of cheek and dust haze behind him. Background road and hills blur into heat haze; dust particles float and catch tiny warm highlights. Shadows are deep and clean, with film grain.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: fluid-pursuers.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Se movÃ­an con una fluidez que era totalmente incorrecta para viajeros.")
prompt: Three or four distant figures crest a rise and move with unsettling fluid coordination, too smooth for ordinary travelers. They flow over uneven ground, silent and inexorable.
Environment: Long road behind, dust and heat haze softening edges and compressing distance. Low sun backlights the silhouettes against a washed gold sky; dust trails in thin ribbons and catches warm highlights at the edges while the figures remain dark. Foreground road texture stays sharp, distant shapes softened by atmospheric blur.
Camera: Sony A7R V 200mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight atmospheric blur. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
