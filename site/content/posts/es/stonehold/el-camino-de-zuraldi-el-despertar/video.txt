## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The cube's brightest face intensifies, the beam sharpening as dust in the air turns into a glittering line. Dulint rotates the cube again, testing it.
[00:03-00:05] The beam refuses to move, staying locked toward the same point on the horizon. Balin takes a half step back, hand hovering near his knife as his eyes track the light.
[00:05-00:08] The hum builds into a felt vibration. Dust on Dulint's knuckles trembles, and his grip tightens until his fingers whiten, breath catching as the road's heat haze swims.

Slow push-in from the beam in the air to Dulint's hands holding the cube.
Audio: low vibrating hum, dry wind over the road, faint leather creak, Dulint's sharp inhale, Balin's boot scuff in dust, distant insects in the hills. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
