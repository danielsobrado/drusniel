## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The cube's symbols accelerate and its low hum swells as Dulint and Balin tighten their forearm clasp. The lantern flame gutters sideways, as if pulled by a draft that is not there.
[00:03-00:05] A single cold pulse flashes from the cube, and both men flinch. Dust on the tabletop shivers in place, then settles as the hum drops to a steady, dangerous throb.
[00:05-00:08] Dulint breaks the clasp and clamps his palm over the cube to smother the glow. Balin nods once without speaking, then reaches for the pack straps, already moving toward departure.

Slow dolly-in from the clasped forearms to the cube.
Audio: lantern crackle, low resonant hum rising and falling, one sharp metal tick, soft scrape of hands on wood, faint grit vibrating, tight breathing. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
