1. filename: dulint-examines-cube.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Expression: puzzled squint, dust on his beard; thick fingers tracing odd angles. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Expression: impatient curiosity, leaning in over his shoulder. In a mine tunnel, Dulint turns a dark metal cube with shifting geometric symbols while Balin watches the scroll and the artifact like it might bite, rough-hewn stone and timber supports closing in around them. A hanging lantern is the only light, warm and close, casting amber onto knuckles and beard braids while the cube throws a faint cold blue-white spill onto their hands. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: thrain-flashback.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "¿Te he hablado alguna vez de mi bisabuelo, el viejo Thrain Barba de Hierro?")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Thrain] D&D dwarf, Expression: legendary pride, chin lifted. Thrain Ironbeard stands in an idealized memory pose, beard heavy with expensive rings that catch light as he holds a worn map close, the paper edges curled and the ink lines faintly glowing like old legend. Firelight is the only light, warm gold that blooms softly on metal and parchment, with smoke haze catching the glow and deep shadows behind. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight halation. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: balin-plotting.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Una lenta sonrisa se dibujó en el rostro de Balin.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Expression: slow grin, mischief and excitement replacing boredom. Balin leans close over the artifacts in the mine, eyes flicking between Dulint and the cube as the plan takes shape, soot and stone dust on the table and his hands. Lantern firelight is the only light, warm amber that catches his cheekbones and the edge of a smile while the background falls into mine-dark. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: secret-pact.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Dulint asintió, repentinamente serio.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] D&D dwarf, Expression: sudden seriousness, eyes hard. [Face_Reference: Balin] D&D dwarf, Expression: eager resolve, grin fading to focus. Dulint and Balin clasp forearms in a dwarven pact over a rough table, the cube sitting between them with symbols shifting as it hums, mine dust and scattered gear around their elbows. Lantern light is warm and low from the side while the cube adds cold blue-white glow from below, splitting shadows across their hands and faces. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: dawn-departure.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Mañana al amanecer.")
prompt:Two dwarven silhouettes with packs step out through a stone doorway at first light, boots crossing from interior shadow into cold mountain air as the path turns toward looming peaks. Sunrise is the only light, pale gold on granite edges and pine needles, long shadows stretching behind them while the world ahead brightens by degrees. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
