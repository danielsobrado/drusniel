## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Dulint shoves the cube down into the pack and yanks the strap tight in one rough motion. Dust bursts around their boots as they launch into movement.
[00:03-00:05] The cold glow leaks through the seam for a heartbeat, then vanishes as the pack swings. Balin glances back toward the hillside, then snaps forward to match Dulint's pace.
[00:05-00:08] Their footsteps speed up, gravel scattering. The road ahead stretches empty, but the air feels charged as the hum settles into a steady pulse under the sound of running.

Handheld camera at ground level tracking alongside their boots and the swinging pack.
Audio: fast footsteps on grit, leather strap slap, dust hiss, a low vibrating hum, Dulint's controlled breathing, distant wind over dry hills. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
