1. filename: boat-waiting-in-tooth-rock-cove.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Tense, jaw set, artifact cold against sternum. Drusniel stands at the edge of a black-rock cove shaped like broken teeth, eyeing a small reinforced boat on wooden rollers. Flat black water stretches beyond under pale sourceless gray light, the air heavy and resentful. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: reinforced-hull-and-supplies.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Los remos yacían asegurados dentro, y había una bobina de cuerda, un odre de agua, y nada más.")
prompt: Small boat close-up: dark treated wood banded with dull metal, slick with a cold sheen not quite moisture. Oars lashed inside beside a coil of rope and a single waterskin. Functional and spare. Black water beyond looks thick and lightless. Pale gray ambient light from no source, catching the wet sheen on metal bands. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: shore-disappears-behind.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "La orilla detrás de él había desaparecido.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Stunned, calculating stare, turning to look behind. View from inside the boat as the shoreline simply stops existing, leaving only black water in every direction under flat gray light, lit without shadows. The world refuses distance and measurement. Sourceless pale gray illumination, no shadows cast anywhere. Canon EOS R5 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: wave-with-wrong-angle.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Una ola se levantó adelante.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Gripping gunwales, fighting for balance, fear breaking through composure. An unnatural wave rises from flat calm, the water lifting at a wrong angle as if pushed from below with intention. The boat tilts violently, heavy black liquid sloshing into the hull around his boots. Dull gray ambient from above, orange-brown glow from beneath the water surface where the wave crests. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: something-circles-below.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Y debajo de él, en la oscuridad bajo el casco, algo se agitó.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Leaning over the side of the rocking boat, face tight with dread, refusing to reach with magic. A vast indistinct shadow shifts just beneath the hull, not attacking, only circling and noticing. Gray featureless light from above, surface too calm between wrong swells. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, slightly out of focus background, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
