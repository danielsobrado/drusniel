1. filename: twelve-hours-like-twelve-days.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes tired but alert, lips moving as he counts turns; one hand sketching routes in the air. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Still as a perched watcher, shoulders tight, gaze fixed toward the entrance. Drusniel paces the near passages for hours, moving from a cathedral-wide chamber into a squeeze-tight throat of obsidian and back, while Srietz holds the shelter line and listens for anything returning from the dark. Slow cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence pools in hollows and skims wet volcanic glass, creating dim mirrored reflections and razor specular streaks on moisture while shadows remain cool and dense. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: srietz-talks-about-vexrath.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "En la sexta hora, Srietz comenzó a hablar.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]. Flat controlled honesty, mouth held tight; posture careful, hands kept close. He sits near Drusniel and talks about losing a name and belonging to Vexrath, voice echoing off volcanic glass, each sentence measured like a cost. Cyan ceiling phosphorescence drops weak top-light that catches pores and the wet sheen at the inner eye corners; glossy obsidian behind him reflects ghosted duplicates, and the cool shadows fall sharply under cheekbones. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-finds-ancient-writing.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Tallada en la pared de obsidiana, casi invisible hasta que sus dedos la rozaron.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Sudden stillness, breath held, eyes narrowing; fingertips pressed to the wall. In a deep passage where the glow thins to almost nothing, he brushes damp obsidian and faint carved grooves catch under his touch, shallow chisel cuts forming archaic glyph-shapes. Weak cyan phosphorescence grazes the wall at a low angle, turning carved lines into thin specular highlights and making gouge edges sparkle; a brief blue-white Beacon reflection adds a hard rim on fingertips and bounces as tiny points across nearby condensation. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.2 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: carved-text-gouged-away.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El texto terminaba abruptamente.")
prompt:Macro close-up of glossy black obsidian with shallow chisel-cut grooves forming an archaic script, then a section violently gouged out, fresh scrape marks and splintered edges, dust and tiny shards clinging inside the cuts. Cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence skims the surface, producing razor specular streaks on polish and deep shadow in gouges; a faint blue-white reflection pulses once and refracts along groove edges like a thin line of fire. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: waiting-with-a-new-mystery.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Regresó a donde Srietz esperaba, los ojos del goblin rastreando su regreso con una expresión que podría haber sido preocupación.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes unsettled, shoulders heavy, one hand rubbing fingertips as if still feeling the grooves. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Measured caution, head slightly tilted, watching for tells. Back in the shelter chamber, Drusniel sits hard against obsidian and the discovery hangs between them like a third presence; the hours keep passing with no sign of Elion. Slow ceiling phosphorescence pulses cold cyan, laying soft top-light across drawn faces and throwing dim mirrored reflections across wet volcanic glass; shadows stay thick and patient. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
