1. filename: movement-in-the-darkness.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Rigid and listening, ears twitching, eyes locked on the dark beyond. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Knife grip white-knuckled, breath held, stance braced at the threshold. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Staggering and hollow-eyed, shoulders slumped, dragging a heavy provision pack that scrapes stone. After the long hungry wait, movement finally resolves in the entrance darkness as Elion lurches back into the cave with supplies, the pack trailing behind him like an anchor across wet obsidian. Cold cyan phosphorescence from inside the cave backlights the figures and turns the floor into black glass, while the outside remains a deep void with only a thin rim of reflected light at the mouth; a brief Beacon pulse adds a blue-white edge on knuckles and pack straps. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: elion-returns-wrecked.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Se veía peor de lo que Drusniel había imaginado posible.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Skin greyed with fever, eyes emptied, lips cracked; hands shaking as he keeps moving. Elion staggers into the cave in lurching steps, sweat slick on his face and neck, dragging the improvised pack behind him as if each scrape costs another breath. The cave's cyan phosphorescence skims wet skin and turns droplets into sharp highlights, while deep shadows pool under cheekbones and the entrance darkness swallows the background. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, natural skin with pores, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drusniel-catches-him.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "El cambiaformas colapsó.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Knees buckling, eyes rolling, body giving out mid-step. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Shock and urgency, jaw clenched, arms outstretched to catch him. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Focused and fast, already tearing at straps, eyes flicking between supplies and threats. Elion collapses at the threshold and Drusniel lunges to catch him before he hits stone, while Srietz rips the provision pack open beside them, scattering the first smell of food into air that has tasted like wet rock for a day. Cold cyan cave phosphorescence throws hard highlights on slick obsidian and wet skin, and the Beacon's faint pulse adds a brief blue-white flicker across hands in motion. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in hands, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: provisions-spread-on-the-floor.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Srietz se sentó sobre sus talones, rodeado por las provisiones que Elion había traído.")
prompt:Photorealistic still life of hard-won provisions spilled across the obsidian floor: preserved meat wrapped in hide, small sacks of grain, dried fruit, water containers, crude bundles of herbs and medicine; grit and moisture cling to everything, and the pile looks heavy with survival. Cyan phosphorescent ceiling glow makes the volcanic glass floor glint like black mirrors, casting crisp specular highlights on container edges and deep shadows between items. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: water-and-new-trust.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel lo sostuvo contra los labios de Elion, forzando pequeños sorbos a pasar por la boca apenas receptiva del cambiaformas.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Unconscious, breathing shallow and rapid, face slick with sweat. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Gentleness under strain, hands steady as he forces tiny sips. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Conflicted calculation, watching and recalculating trust in silence. Elion lies propped against an obsidian wall that holds faint residual warmth, while Drusniel tips a small container to his lips and counts each swallow; Srietz hovers near stacked supplies, eyes tracking both the patient and the cave mouth. Cold cyan phosphorescence paints soft top-light over drawn faces and wet stone, and occasional blue-white reflections from the Beacon flicker across water and knuckles like brief signals. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
