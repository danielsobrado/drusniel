1. filename: cage-sways-on-the-road.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes hard with counting; fingers white-knuckled on the bars. He braces as the cage sways on a slaver wagon. Iron-bar cage bolted to a wagon frame, scuffed plank floor, other cages flashing past through gaps; black sand road and heat-fractured basalt needles outside under red-grey twilight. A swinging wagon lantern throws warm amber bands that rake across pitted iron and catch on sweat sheen; cold twilight and far volcanic glow provide desaturated fill, with orange reflections smearing across scratched metal and damp knuckles. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur from the sway, dust in the air. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: cracks-in-the-bars.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "*Ciento cuarenta y siete grietas en los barrotes de la jaula. Ya las había trazado dos veces.*")
prompt:Blue-ash skinned fingertips trace hairline fractures in pitted forged-iron bars, leaving black grit and metal flakes in the creases. Extreme macro on rust seams and crack edges vibrating with the wagon's movement, background smeared into streaks. Lantern tungsten light swings nearby, producing moving specular points that skate along fracture ridges and catch on rust crystals; dim red-grey twilight leaks through as cold fill and turns the iron into matte charcoal with wet-looking highlights. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: other-prisoners-avoid-him.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Los otros prisioneros lo evitaban.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Expression closed and watchful; eyes flick sideways without turning the head. He shifts once and the neighboring prisoners recoil and look away, whispers dying mid-word. Two adjacent cages on wagons, chains clinking beneath, breath vapor hanging in cold air over black sand. Lantern spill paints thin amber lines across damp iron bars and bounces warm light into eye corners; twilight fill stays blue-grey, leaving faces half-lost behind the grille. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, background slightly out of focus. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-creature-watches.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Y observaba a la criatura en la jaula del fondo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Unblinking curiosity; a faint almost-smile that never fully forms. He sits steady as the rear cage rocks, eyes fixed through bars toward Drusniel, red markings flashing with each sway. Condensation beads on iron, road dust drifts between wagons, and distant crystal growths throw wrong prismatic glints. Wagon lantern tungsten light creates halation and warm rim highlights on cheekbones and bar edges; low volcanic glow adds orange backlight, reflections crawling across damp iron like thin liquid. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, slight lens flare. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: caravan-through-wrong-landscape.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El paisaje fuera de su jaula era extraño y hostil.")
prompt:Three slaver wagons with iron cages sway across black sand toward a pulsing volcanic horizon; guards walk beside with practiced boredom as grit whips at boots. Twisted vesicular basalt spires and glassy crystal growths scatter light into wrong angles, with scratched ironwork and wagon wheels peppered by black sand. Distant volcanic fissure glow casts thin orange highlights along armor edges and wheel rims; cool twilight fill keeps shadows blue-grey, and violet crystal reflections add spectral streaks on metal as the caravan moves. Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
