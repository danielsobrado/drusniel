1. filename: lost-in-shifting-forest.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, three days of travel wear; Drusniel keeps his eyes down and lips barely moving as he counts steps, posture steady despite fatigue, while Elion scans the treeline with controlled tension and a tight jaw. They walk through a warped stretch of Wyrmreach forest where every direction repeats: black volcanic grit under tangled roots, twisted stone formations like broken teeth, and plants that shift in rhythms that ignore the wind; half-seen skull carvings and deliberate crystal markers appear on bark and rock as they pass, a steady suggestion of watchers just beyond sight. Dim overcast daylight filters through a thin canopy and ash-haze, giving cold grey fill; the stones and branches throw shadows that subtly skew the wrong way, as if the light source is inconsistent from one step to the next. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed, slight motion blur in drifting grit. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drusniel-counts-steps.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel había contado sus pasos durante tres días ya.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, cold calculation under strain; lips barely moving with each counted step, eyes flicking down and forward as if numbers are the only stable thing here, cloak dusted with black grit. Close portrait while he walks, shoulders held level; behind him the forest collapses into repeating trunks and basalt spurs that blur into near-identical silhouettes, making distance feel meaningless. Cold grey sky light seeps through the canopy and catches as dull highlights on damp stone and leaf edges; a thin rim of paler light outlines his cheek and jaw when he passes a lighter patch of bark, while the background falls into soft shadow. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: territory-marks-skull-and-crystals.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las marcas habían comenzado a aparecer hacía dos días.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro detail of a fresh skull-shaped carving cut into wet tree bark: torn wood fibers, sap beading at the edges, and a deliberate cluster of crystalline growths wedged into a basalt crevice nearby as if placed by hand. Volcanic grit and damp black moss cling to roots at the base; a faint oily shimmer hangs close to the surface, visible only where it distorts the background like heat haze. Diffuse overcast daylight from above turns the scene cold and flat, while wet sap and crystal facets catch small hard specular points that make the carving feel newly made. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: elion-says-we-are-watched.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "—Algo nos está observando —dijo Elion.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Photorealistic, alarmed restraint; stopping mid-step with eyes widened and fixed on the treeline, fingers curling and then forcing stillness as he says they are being watched. The warped forest behind him repeats into crooked trunks and stone spires that fade into grey haze, making his pause feel like an interruption in a loop; the air looks heavy, the undergrowth subtly shifting without a clear cause. Cold overcast daylight provides flat grey fill from above, but a thin break in the canopy drops a paler patch of light across one side of his face and shoulder, leaving the other side in cool shadow as if the forest itself is choosing what to reveal. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: screech-in-the-treeline.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Entonces lo escuchó.")
prompt:Photorealistic, tense wide shot at the treeline as a thin predatory shriek cuts through the hush: Drusniel and Elion half-turn toward a gap between trunks where something small and fast hides behind bark, revealed only in a blur of motion and a brief glint where an eye should be. Twisted stone formations and root nets frame the opening; nearby plants tremble in a rhythm that does not match the air, and the ground is black with volcanic grit that looks disturbed by recent movement. Dim overcast daylight filters through the canopy, but the shadows around the gap skew in the wrong direction, hinting at a second unseen source deeper in the trees. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.0 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur on the darting shape, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
