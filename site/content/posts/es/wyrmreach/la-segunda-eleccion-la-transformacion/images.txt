1. filename: elion-steps-into-the-center.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Shoulders squared, face pale, hands trembling but held still; he measures the cost. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Guarded worry, jaw tight, stance anchored against the wall. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Recoiled, lips parted, eyes fixed on Elion, fingers worrying at cloth. Elion steps into the center of the cramped obsidian cave and asks for space, leaving a hard empty circle between him and the others; moisture beads on black-glass walls and the air feels cold enough to sting lungs. Faint cyan-green phosphorescence from patchy ceiling growth gives weak top-light that skims wet stone facets, while a subtle blue-white pulse leaking from the Beacon under cloth adds brief hard highlights on knuckles and cheekbones. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: transformation-begins.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El primer sonido fue un crujido—hueso, inconfundiblemente.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Eyes squeezed shut, brow knotted, teeth set; sweat beading at the hairline. He stands in the center as the first crack hits and his posture pulls wrong, spine bowing under skin that ripples as if bone is sliding and reforming; breath catches and wet obsidian reflections crowd the frame. Cold cyan-green phosphorescence from above rakes across sweat and stretched skin, throwing sharp specular lines on moisture and deep shadows under collarbones; a brief blue-white pulse from the Beacon flashes and then fades. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight halation in highlights. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: drusniel-forces-himself-to-watch.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel se forzó a mirar.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes unblinking, nostrils flared, jaw locked; one hand half raised and then forced down. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Staggering backward, hands clamped over ears, eyes wide and wet, shoulders hunched. Drusniel forces himself to watch from the cave wall while the center of the chamber writhes in and out of focus, Elion's silhouette elongating in nauseating increments; Srietz scrapes a heel on slick stone as he retreats, breath stuttering. The ceiling's weak cyan phosphorescence pulses unevenly like a failing heartbeat and catches on wet obsidian to throw fractured reflections across their faces; the Beacon's cold blue-white glint adds a brief edge-light on fingers and eyelids. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in the background, subtle lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: built-for-speed.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La criatura en el centro de la cueva estaba construida para la velocidad—larga, baja, ángulos diseñados para correr en lugar de pelear.")
prompt:Photorealistic dark fantasy realism; the transformation finishes and leaves a low, long creature coiled in the center of the obsidian cave, sinewy and efficient, joints arranged for sprinting rather than fighting; it locks eyes with the watchers for a heartbeat, something familiar trapped in the stare, then launches into the tunnel so fast its limbs smear into motion. Faint cyan-green phosphorescence from the ceiling skims along wet muscle and black-glass stone, and the sudden movement throws shifting shadows that strobe across cave walls in fractured reflections. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur on the creature, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: the-cave-feels-empty.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "La cueva se sentía más vacía sin Elion.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Hollow-eyed, shoulders heavy, counting under his breath with a fixed stare. [Face_Reference: Srietz] Rigid in his corner, fingers pressed to his lips, refusing to look at the empty center. After the sprint into darkness, the obsidian cave feels larger and colder; two survivors sit in separate corners and measure time by the slow pulse overhead, listening to water ticks and distant stone while the space where Elion stood stays empty. The ceiling's cyan phosphorescence pulses with long falloff, turning puddles into dim mirrors and casting soft top-light on slack hands and drawn faces; occasional blue-white reflections flicker off wet facets like brief ghosts. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
