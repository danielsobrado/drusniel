## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Elion centers his stance, breathes once, then the first bone-crack snaps through the cave as his shoulders jerk out of alignment.
[00:03-00:05] Drusniel forces his eyes open and doesn't blink; Srietz stumbles back, clamps hands over his ears, and the phosphorescent glow pulses harder as wet reflections jitter across obsidian.
[00:05-00:08] Elion's shape finishes re-forming in a final violent shudder, then the new body launches into the tunnel and vanishes, leaving the two others frozen in the sudden quiet.

Handheld.
Audio: bone crack, wet scrape, sharp inhales, water drips, fabric rustle, a faint low hum from the Beacon, distant rock tick. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
