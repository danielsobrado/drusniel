1. filename: rowboat-on-nightmare-sea.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Soaked, exhausted, cloak clinging to frame, oars in hand. Wide shot of a small battered rowboat on the Nightmare Sea under flat endless gray light. Water is wrong, tar-dark, waves arriving from impossible angles. Ankle-deep black water sloshes inside the boat. Sourceless gray ambient light, no shadows, cold flat illumination from every direction. Canon EOS R5 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: bailing-wrong-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Cada puñado que arrojaba por la borda parecía jalar sus manos, reacio a irse, y para cuando había limpiado una sección, otra ola había vuelto a llenarlo.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Raw knuckles, shaking hands, bailing desperately. Tight close-up of cupped hands throwing thick black water overboard as the boat rocks. The water clings and pulls at his fingers, droplets stretching unnaturally before falling. Skin wet and chilled. Gritty wet wood grain. Flat gray light catching the unnatural viscosity of the black liquid. Sony A7R IV 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: rowing-while-counting-breaks.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Tres remadas. Cuatro.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Face locked in concentration, muscles tensing in confusion. Strained rowing moment as he grips the oars and pulls through water whose density changes mid-stroke, one oar biting like tar while the other slips like fog. The boat tilts as the sea pushes from below. Sourceless gray light illuminating him from no fixed direction. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, not perfectly exposed, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: air-magic-jerk-forward.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Drusniel alcanzó su magia de aire.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Expression showing effort and fear of drawing attention. A short unnatural gust forms at the stern and shoves the rowboat forward in jerking bursts while an artifact at his chest pulses hard, resisting. Spray and mist tear sideways. Gray light flickers across wet skin. The gust is visible as a distortion at the stern, catching spray particles. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: something-brushes-the-hull.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Algo rozó el fondo del casco.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Frozen with oars suspended mid-stroke, eyes wide, refusing to reach with water magic. Ominous stillness on the water as something soft and deliberate brushes the underside of the hull, stabilizing the boat too gently. Ankle-deep wrong water presses against his boots. Gray fog and faint ripples radiate outward into emptiness. Flat gray ambient, no directional source. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, slightly out of focus background, film grain not visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
