1. filename: opening-the-cage.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, urgent focus; breath held as he pushes the last bit of control through a thin thread of magic. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Hands locked on the bars, eyes wide with a freedom he doesn't trust yet; chest lifting like he forgot how to breathe. Drusniel presses his palm to the corroded lock as Elion clings to the cage door; the metal resists, then gives, and the door cracks open while guards remain turned outward at the perimeter. A nearby lantern throws warm tungsten light that glints off damp iron and highlights condensation on bars, while the red-grey sky and distant volcanic glow keep everything else dim and cold. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: corroded-lock-mechanism.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel presionó su mano contra la cerradura.")
prompt:Photorealistic extreme close-up of an old cage lock: pitted metal, rust seams, and stubborn internal pins resisting as if designed to stick; fingertips press steady and the mechanism shifts with a tiny decisive click, iron bars framing the shot as grit vibrates with the wagon's settling. Lantern tungsten light creates hard specular points on worn metal and warm halation on edges, with cold twilight fill flattening the background into dark red-grey. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: oil-on-the-fourth-wagon.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel derramó el aceite sobre la carga del carro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, face blank while the eyes stay locked on the task; hands moving fast and precise. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Guarding, head turning at an angle that feels wrong, scanning without fear. Drusniel tips a container and pours thick lamp oil over the fourth wagon’s cargo, wet sheen soaking into rough wood and rope while Elion keeps watch; a distant guard begins to turn at the wrong moment, lanterns shifting as confusion starts to bloom. Lantern spill paints warm orange reflections on the oil surface and container rims, while red-grey twilight keeps the ground and rock cold and desaturated. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the pour, natural texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: running-into-stone-teeth.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Se sumergieron en las formaciones de piedra retorcidas que bordeaban el camino.")
prompt:Photorealistic chase angle as two prisoners sprint off the road and plunge into twisted stone formations that rise like broken teeth; boots pound over jagged rock and black grit as lanterns and guards shrink behind them into scattered points of light. The eternal red-grey twilight keeps the landscape flat and hostile, while the caravan lanterns add warm moving highlights that flicker across sharp stone edges and briefly catch on dust in the air. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, motion blur in their sprint, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: distant-wagon-burns.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Detrás de ellos, muy distante ahora, algo se incendió.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, shaking with exhaustion and adrenaline; shoulders hunched as he fights for air. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Breathing hard, eyes still alert, body coiled to move again. Hidden between jagged rock teeth, they press into cold stone and listen; far behind them the fourth wagon finally burns, flames licking the red-grey sky as a distant orange smear and reflecting faintly on dust. The distant fire provides the only warm light, a weak orange pulse that barely reaches the rocks, while everything near them stays cold and dim under volcanic haze. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare from distant flame. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
