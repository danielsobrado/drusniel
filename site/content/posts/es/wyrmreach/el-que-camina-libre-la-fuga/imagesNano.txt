1. filename: opening-the-cage.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Urgent focus; breath held as he pushes a thin thread of magic. [Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Hands locked on bars, eyes wide, chest lifting like he forgot how to breathe. Drusniel presses palm to a corroded lock while Elion clings to the door; the metal resists, then gives, and the door cracks open as guards remain turned outward at the perimeter. Lantern tungsten light glints off damp iron and highlights condensation beads; red-grey sky and distant volcanic glow provide cold fill, with amber reflections smearing across scratched metal and wet knuckles. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: corroded-lock-mechanism.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel presionó su mano contra la cerradura.")
prompt:Fingertips press steady on an old lock as internal pins resist, then shift with a tiny decisive click. Extreme macro on pitted metal, rust seams, and worn edges vibrating with the caravan's settling; iron bars frame the view. Lantern tungsten light creates hard specular points that skate across micro-scratches and rust crystals; cold twilight fill flattens the background to dark red-grey and deepens the lock's shadow gradients. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: oil-on-the-fourth-wagon.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel derramó el aceite sobre la carga del carro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Face blank, eyes locked on the task; hands moving fast and precise. [Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Guarding, head turning at a slightly wrong angle, scanning without fear. Thick lamp oil pours over rough wood and rope cargo, wet sheen soaking into grain; a distant guard begins to turn at the wrong moment as lanterns shift and confusion blooms. Lantern spill makes the oil surface mirror-bright with orange highlights and creates glossy reflections on container rims; red-grey twilight stays cold, leaving the rock and ground desaturated while warm bounce lights the underside of hands and jawlines. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight motion blur in the pour. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: running-into-stone-teeth.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Se sumergieron en las formaciones de piedra retorcidas que bordeaban el camino.")
prompt:Two prisoners sprint off the road and plunge into twisted basalt formations that rise like broken teeth, boots pounding over jagged rock and black grit as lanterns and guards shrink behind them. The stone is heat-fractured and sharp-edged, dust whipping through the gaps like breath. Lantern points behind create warm moving highlights that flicker across knife-like edges and catch on airborne dust; red-grey twilight fill keeps the maze cold and flat, with shadow pockets turning near-black between the teeth. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, motion blur in the sprint, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: distant-wagon-burns.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Detrás de ellos, muy distante ahora, algo se incendió.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Shaking with exhaustion and adrenaline, shoulders hunched as he fights for air. [Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Breathing hard, eyes still alert, body coiled to move. Hidden between jagged stone teeth, they press into cold rock and listen; far behind the fourth wagon finally burns, flames licking the red-grey sky as a distant orange smear. The distant fire provides weak warm pulses that barely reach the rocks, creating faint orange edge highlights on dust and stone; everything near them stays cold and dim under volcanic haze with deep shadows swallowing detail. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, subtle lens flare from distant flame. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
