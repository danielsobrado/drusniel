1. filename: safe-dark-obsidian-caves.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Jaw set, eyes scanning; hands counting scraps. [Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . Clinical stare, damp fingers, crouched near the dripping seam. [Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Collapsed, trembling, breath shallow and fast. Three exhausted travelers huddle deep in obsidian caves where sound feels swallowed, black-glass walls reflecting weak light, ceiling dusted with faint phosphorescent growth and beads of condensation. Ceiling phosphorescence emits cold cyan-green top-light that skims wet obsidian facets, producing razor specular streaks and ghost reflections; the Beacon's intermittent blue-white pulse leaks through cloth and paints brief hard highlights on cheek edges and droplets while shadows stay cool and dense. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: srietz-tests-the-water.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "El goblin pasó un dedo a lo largo de la obsidiana, lo llevó a sus labios—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . Lips pressed, eyes focused; fingertip wet with condensation, then lifted to taste. Wet obsidian surface with beaded droplets and smeared moisture lines, black crystal facets sharp in macro detail. Cold ceiling phosphorescence creates hard specular points on droplets and razor highlights along crystal edges; the Beacon pulse adds brief blue-white glints that reflect as tiny points in the wet surface and bounce faintly into the skin pores around the mouth. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: elion-exhausted-after-partial-changes.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Se había desplomado contra la pared de la cueva en el momento en que dejaron de correr, su respiración superficial y rápida.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Shaking, breath short and fast after shifting; hands clenched, eyes unfocused. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Worry held back, gaze steady, posture protective without moving closer. Elion trembles against the obsidian wall inside a cramped black-glass passage where every surface reflects weak light like broken mirrors, condensation streaks visible on stone. Cold phosphorescence paints cyan edges on skin and wet rock; the Beacon's intermittent blue-white pulse throws brief highlights across trembling hands and creates sharp moving reflections in the obsidian, with shadows staying dense and cool. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-beacon-points-northeast.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El Faro pulsaba contra su pecho, caliente a través de la tela, apuntando al noreste como siempre hacía.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Eyes wide and sleepless, jaw tight; one hand hovering near his chest without touching. He holds still, listening, gaze fixed toward a northeast tunnel mouth as condensation ticks on obsidian. The Beacon pulse is the primary light, spilling cold blue-white glow onto chin and knuckles in rhythmic bursts; faint ceiling phosphorescence adds thin cyan fill that turns obsidian reflections into ghosted duplicates, with wet stone showing sharp specular highlights that shift between pulses. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight halation in highlights, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: condensation-is-survival.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel contó sus recursos en la oscuridad: tres personas, sin provisiones, sin comida, agua solo si la humedad en las paredes podía recolectarse.")
prompt:Condensation gathers into fat droplets on heat-fractured obsidian and drips into a crude improvised container, each drop catching faint phosphorescence like a tiny signal, splashing into silence. Macro detail of black-glass crystal facets, moisture films, and mineral streaks. Cold cyan ceiling glow creates sharp specular highlights on droplets and long reflective streaks on wet stone; occasional blue pulse reflections add brief icy glints that dance across the container rim and nearby crystal edges. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
