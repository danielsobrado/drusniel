## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Elion speaks with measured calm, delivering weight. Campfire embers flicker, casting shifting orange light upward across both faces. Drusniel is still, listening intently.
[00:03-00:06] Drusniel's expression shifts — subtle, devastating. His jaw tightens. His eyes widen fractionally, then go flat. The ember glow pulses unevenly, shadows dancing across volcanic rock.
[00:06-00:08] Drusniel looks away. His hand finds the rock beside him and grips it, thumbnail tracing the crack. Elion watches him, waiting. Ash drifts between them in the silence.

Static camera, locked off. Let the faces carry the shot.
Audio: crackling embers, faint wind, distant volcanic rumble. The scrape of a nail on stone. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
