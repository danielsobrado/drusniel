[Face_Reference: Elion] Quiet alertness. Talryn leads three travelers along a narrow trail through black volcanic terrain, cultivated rows of dark flowers fading behind, steaming fissures crossing barren soil.

prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Leaning in, brow furrowed. [Face_Reference: Elion] Speaking low, eyes steady. Two figures sit close at a small campfire on volcanic rock at night, speaking in hushed tones. Beyond the firelight a female silhouette patrols the perimeter. Campfire embers cast orange light on their faces from below, darkness pressing in from all sides. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores.

prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn] Blank expression, standing two meters away, looking down. Low angle as if seen through half-closed eyes.
