1. filename: shattered-volcanic-plates.jpg
role: header
prompt:Massive broken volcanic basalt plates separated by glowing chasms, vesicular basalt fractured along cooling joints, steam venting from below. Three small figures navigating the shattered terrain with a guide ahead. Distant lava fountains on the horizon. Dull orange underglow from chasms reflects off the wet surfaces of fractured plates, sulfuric haze scatters the light into diffuse amber bands across the middle distance. Shadows tinged molten orange at edges where chasm light spills upward onto plate undersides. Sony A7R V 16mm f/4, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: srietz-nearly-falls.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Srietz cayo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]. Wide-eyed panic, clawed fingers scrabbling at crumbling stone edge. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Lunging forward, arm extended, desperation in the reach. Goblin slides over the edge of a broken basalt plate as drow reaches to grab him, steam and orange glow rising from the chasm below. Lava light from beneath illuminates both figures from below, casting interactive orange-red underglow onto their chins, hands, and the underside of Drusniel's outstretched arm. Heat-fractured basalt crumbles under Srietz's claws. Shadows tinged deep red at edges. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8, Cinestill 800T, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-reaches-for-voice.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Busco la Voz.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Eyes slightly unfocused, looking inward. One hand extended reaching for something invisible. Expectation turning to confusion on his face. Standing on broken volcanic rock with steam curling around his legs. Orange glow from a nearby fissure catches one side of his face with warm interactive highlights on his cheekbone and brow ridge, the other half lost in cold volcanic shadow. Steam refracts the fissure light into soft amber diffusion around his silhouette. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: group-pulls-srietz-up.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Lo subieron a la antigua usanza.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Straining with effort, teeth clenched, muscles taut. [Face_Reference: Elion]. Bracing against rock, pulling rope with both hands. [Face_Reference: Srietz]. Gripping the lip of the plate edge, relief breaking through fear. Drow and half-elf haul goblin up over the edge of a broken volcanic plate using rope and grip strength, steam rising from the chasm behind them. Orange chasm glow from below silhouettes their straining bodies, interactive warm light reflects off sweat-slicked forearms and taut rope fibers. Vesicular basalt crumbles at the edge under weight. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8, Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: scorchshells-crossing-gap.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Las pequenas criaturas acorazadas cruzaron la brecha y desaparecieron en la piedra.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Watching from above with analytical attention, crouching at plate edge. Small armored crab-turtle creatures with dark chitinous shells scurry across a gap between broken volcanic plates, vanishing into narrow crevices. Shells exhibit hammer-scale surface texture from thermal exposure. Orange glow from the chasm catches their shells with interactive highlights, each carapace reflecting a distinct warm point of light as they cross. Vesicular basalt texture visible at crevice edges. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 macro, Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
