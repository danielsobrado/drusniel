## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:02] Srietz's clawed fingers slip on crumbling basalt. His body drops — legs kicking against nothing, one hand still gripping the edge. Rock fragments tumble into the glowing chasm below.
[00:02-00:05] Drusniel lunges. His hand closes around Srietz's wrist. The momentum pulls him forward, chest slamming against the plate edge. Steam billows up between them, orange-lit from the chasm below.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel strains, pulling upward. Srietz's second hand finds the edge. Slow-motion as the goblin clears the lip. Both collapse backward onto solid rock, breathing hard.

Slow push-in from medium to tight on the gripping hands.
Audio: cracking stone, rushing steam, grunt of effort, scraping claws on basalt, heavy breathing. Deep sub-bass rumble from the chasm. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy, realistic physics.
