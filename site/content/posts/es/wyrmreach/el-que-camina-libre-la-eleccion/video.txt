## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel presses his palm to the lock; air tightens, dust lifts, and the corroded mechanism shudders under invisible pressure.
[00:03-00:05] The lock clicks; the door swings and he slips out in one fluid move, feet hitting the wagon plank with a dull thud.
[00:05-00:08] He sprints toward the rear cage as lantern light whips across iron; two guards keep their backs turned to watch the perimeter, and chains rattle as the wagons settle.

Handheld.
Audio: quiet iron click, cage hinge creak, fast footfalls on wood, chain clinks, lantern metal squeak, wind hiss over grit, distant guard gear clatter. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
