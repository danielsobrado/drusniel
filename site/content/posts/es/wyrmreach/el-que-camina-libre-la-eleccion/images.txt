1. filename: the-choice-to-not-run-alone.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, eyes narrowed as he feels a thin thread of magic return; stillness that hides a decision forming. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Watching in silence, intent and patient, as if waiting for the exact second. Inside two swaying cages on the fourth day, Drusniel sits with hands hidden in his lap while the wagon rattles over black sand; across the gap, Elion stays pressed near the bars, the space between them heavy with the choice to run alone or open another lock. Flat red-grey twilight seeps through canvas and iron, while a wagon lantern throws warm amber slashes across bars and faces and a distant volcanic glow stains the horizon with low orange. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight motion blur from wagon sway, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: a-thread-of-air-magic.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel lo probó cuidadosamente, manteniendo las manos ocultas, sintiendo el aire responder a su voluntad.")
prompt:Photorealistic close-up on hidden hands in a prisoner’s lap as a tiny controlled breeze stirs dust motes and loose black grit across the cage floor; the movement is subtle but deliberate, proof the air responds again, while iron bars and wagon vibration turn the background into soft smears. A lantern hung on the wagon frame provides warm tungsten light that catches on drifting dust and makes it sparkle, with cold twilight leaking in as flat fill. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: elion-knows-things.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "La criatura le había hablado tres veces más desde esa primera noche.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, hard calculating stare; listening without reacting. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Speaking in short stolen moments, eyes intent as if receiving information without a source. Tight two-shot through iron bars as the wagon rolls; in the blurred background a guard with a bad knee crosses during rotation, weapon belt clinking, while dust and ash drift between cages. A lantern throws warm highlights that rake across bar edges and catch in eyes, while red-grey twilight keeps the rest of the scene cold and desaturated. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, background softly out of focus, slight lens flare. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: oil-for-distraction.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Fuego. El cuarto carro. Llevaba aceite de lámpara para el viaje—lo había olido el tercer día.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, face blank while the eyes lock onto a target; the smallest flare of intent held tight. The supply wagon stops and a tarp lifts, revealing sealed oil containers stacked among provisions; Drusniel watches through his cage bars, tasting the sharp smell as black grit swirls at the wheels. Overcast twilight stays flat and cold, while a guard lantern and a brief torch flare spill warm orange across the container rims and paint thin shadow lines from the bars over Drusniel’s face. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, natural texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: he-opens-his-lock-and-runs.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El mecanismo hizo clic.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, breath held and eyes razor-focused; muscles already moving before the sound finishes. In the deepest stretch of watch, Drusniel presses his palm to the corroded lock and releases one precise push of air; the mechanism clicks and the cage door swings open, and instead of fleeing he sprints toward Elion’s cage while two distant guards face the perimeter, unaware. Lantern light swings and stutters across the ground, catching on iron and making his shadow jump, while the red-grey sky and faint volcanic glow keep everything else dim and hostile. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, motion blur in his sprint, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
