1. filename: questions-by-the-pot.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: easy smile that never reaches his eyes, stirring steadily as he asks. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: guarded stare, measuring every word, posture still despite fatigue. Under the tarp shelter, Merrik stirs broth in a dented pot over a small fire while Drusniel sits opposite, listening and counting; the black coast and wrong twilight stain the canvas beyond the shelter mouth. Firelight is the key source, warm orange flicker creating interactive highlights on spoon, knuckles, and pot dents; red-grey ambient from the sky fills shadows cold and flat, keeping the far shore muted. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: thirty-four-questions-counted.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "*Treinta y cuatro preguntas ahora*, contó Drusniel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: focused and clinical, fingers steady as he records the count. Close shot of Drusniel scratching tally marks into black sand beside the bedding (no legible words), eyes tracking the grooves like coordinates while the cold, silent artifact hangs heavy under damp fabric. Low firelight rakes across knuckles and sand grains, sharp specular points catching each fresh groove; everything beyond the hand drops into deep tarp shadow with faint red-grey ambient outlining the shelter edge. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 Macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: convenient-caravan.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "He estado preguntando por ahí—hay una caravana yendo al este en unos días.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Merrik]. Expression: pleasant held too smoothly, eyes calculating as he mentions contacts and a safe caravan. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: suspicion hardening, jaw tightening as the pattern clicks. Tight two-shot under the tarp as Merrik talks, supplies and the dented pot crowding the edge of frame like evidence. Firelight warms one side of each face from below, interactive amber highlights catching pores and knuckle ridges; red-grey twilight fills the other side cold and flat, keeping the background matte and uneasy. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: too-many-steps-at-night.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Pero los sonidos parecían mal.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Expression: eyes open in shadow, listening hard, body still. Late in the red-grey night, too many footsteps move outside the shelter; packed bundles and supplies sit staged for departure, and the fire has collapsed to embers. Ember glow is the only warm light, tiny orange points catching on bowl rim and fabric folds; cold twilight ambient presses in from outside, flattening the sand to near-black and leaving long soft shadows under the tarp. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: caravan-arrives-early.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "La caravana había llegado temprano.")
prompt:Photorealistic wide shot on the black-sand coast as wagon wheels roll in and a covered caravan arrives early, silhouettes resolving through ash haze and drifting grit; fresh ruts and churned sand lead straight toward the shelter. Diffuse red-grey twilight from the sky provides flat fill; distant volcanic glow adds faint warm edges to wagon frames and moving figures, warm highlights sliding along wet wood while the sand stays matte and dead. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Ektar 100, slight motion blur in the nearest wheel, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
