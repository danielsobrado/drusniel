1. filename: night-stop-the-creature-speaks.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Sleepless focus; eyes tracking the watch change without moving. [Face_Reference: Elion]. Pressed to the bars, voice finally used, curiosity sharpened into intent. Night rest at the stopped caravan: cages wrapped in rough canvas and rope, guards trading watch beside a low fire, weapons clinking softly; Drusniel peers through a canopy gap at a starless red-grey sky while Elion leans in from the rear cage to speak. Firelight throws warm orange flicker upward, catching condensation beads on iron and painting under-chin highlights; a lantern adds tighter tungsten spill that bounces off damp bars into eye corners, while volcanic haze keeps the background cold and dim with ash drifting through the beam. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: you-are-not-afraid.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "—No tienes miedo.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Calm absence of fear; gaze steady through the bars. [Face_Reference: Elion]. Watching from behind with focused patience, barely moving. Tight portrait framed by iron slats as Drusniel turns toward the voice; neighboring prisoners shrink back into shadow at the edge while Elion stays fixed from the rear cage. A lantern on the wagon frame creates hard warm highlights on pitted iron and soft falloff across faces; the dying campfire adds low orange uplight that reflects as tiny ember points in wet eyes, while everything beyond the tarps sinks into cold twilight. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight lens flare. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: red-marks-in-twilight.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Las marcas rojas en su rostro parecían más oscuras en el crepúsculo, más como heridas que pintura.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Intelligent patience; head tilted at a slightly wrong angle, almost-smile restrained. He speaks low and rough at the bars as dust and ash drift between iron slats. Lantern light from below-left carves warm highlights along cheekbones and catches beadlike condensation on iron; red-grey sky fill stays cold, leaving the far side of the face in shadow and making the markings read darker, like old wounds under bad light. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, background softly out of focus. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: the-debt-pulses.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La deuda pulsó en el pecho de Drusniel—silenciosa, paciente, imposible de ignorar ahora que había sido nombrada.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]. Jaw tightening; one hand pressed hard to the sternum as if bracing against a second weight. [Face_Reference: Elion]. Matter-of-fact delivery, eyes never leaving him. Two cages under canvas: Drusniel sits up and grips cloth at his chest while Elion speaks across the gap; guard boots shift nearby and chains settle with a metallic sigh. Campfire flicker throws warm moving bands that crawl across damp iron; a lantern adds tight tungsten spill that bounces off wet bars into faces, making breath vapor and drifting smoke visible as layered haze. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur in smoke, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: walk-free-smile.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "La sonrisa de Elion fue repentina y afilada y no del todo humana.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Sudden sharp smile that turns inhuman for an instant; eyes bright with a decision. He leans back from the bars as guard voices and boots drift closer and tarp shadows stripe the cages like a held breath. A swinging lantern throws warm bands that rake across teeth and ironwork; the campfire gives low orange underlight that reflects off damp bars and catches as tiny highlights in the eyes, while the rest of the scene stays cold and red-grey under volcanic haze. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle lens flare, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
