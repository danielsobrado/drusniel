1. filename: endless-gray-nightmare-sea.jpg
role: header
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Hunched over oars, salt and grime smeared on his skin, rowing into a horizon that never moves. A small battered wooden boat alone on an impossible flat expanse of black water. No sun. No true shadows. The silence is heavy and wrong.
Environment: Nightmare Sea open water. Uniform gray sourceless light from every direction. The black water surface is perfectly flat, absorbing all light, returning no reflection. No horizon distinguishable. The air is dead, no mist movement, no wind. The boat leaves no wake. Gray light sits on the water like a membrane.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, underexposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography.

2. filename: numb-hands-on-oars.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Drusniel no podía sentir sus manos más.")
prompt: Close-up on hands gripping wet oar handles with white knuckles. Skin raw and numb. Water splashing against the boat soaking his legs. The black surface too thick and lightless. The air dead and still.
Environment: Inside the rowboat. Flat gray ambient catches the wet wood grain of the oar handles, showing water absorption swelling the fibers. Salt deposits crystallize along the knuckle ridges. The black water on his legs has visible weight, pressing fabric flat. The oar handle shows grip-wear from hours of rowing. No shadow falls from the hands.
Camera: Sony A7R V 100mm macro GM Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field, natural skin texture. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography.

3. filename: wall-of-black-water.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Una ola se levantó adelante.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Exhaustion and terror, rowing straight toward it. A vertical wall of black water rises ahead, not a wave but a suspended dark cliff defying gravity. Skin tight with strain. The boat is tiny against the wall.
Environment: Nightmare Sea. The wave wall is perfectly vertical, surface smooth and unnaturally still despite its height. Faint luminescence crawls along its crest where gray ambient light bends. The water surface below is flat calm. The gray sky reflects nowhere on the wave face. The dark surface absorbs all light, appearing as a void with edges.
Camera: Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 GM Cinestill 800T, underexposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography.

4. filename: drowning-vision-silence.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La proa golpeó la pared de agua, y la realidad se rompió.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Eyes wide and unfocused, mouth open, sinking without a boat in pitch-black liquid. Black water invades his mouth and nose. The scene is impossibly still. The entire sea is holding its breath. Vast presence suggested only by pressure.
Environment: Submerged in the Nightmare Sea. Dying gray light from directly above fades to absolute black in every other direction. The liquid is not water but something denser, darker. No bubbles escape his mouth. No current moves him. The blackness below has depth that suggests intelligence. Pressure increases visibly, compressing his clothing against his body.
Camera: Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, heavily underexposed, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography.

5. filename: back-in-the-boat-debt.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El dolor explotó a través de su pecho.")
prompt: [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Jolting upright in the boat with a ragged gasp, clutching his chest. Pain and a new invisible weight settle beneath his ribs. Oars locked in his grip as if his body kept rowing through the nightmare. Black water laps at his shins.
Environment: Nightmare Sea, transition zone. The gray light ahead shifts almost imperceptibly toward having direction, the faintest suggestion of distance. A colder pulse presses at his sternum visible as tension in wet clothing. The water inside the boat sloshes with slightly more normal physics. The flat gray begins to differentiate into lighter ahead and darker behind.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography.
