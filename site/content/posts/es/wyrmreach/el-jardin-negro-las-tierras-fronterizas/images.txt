1. filename: black-garden-borderlands-overlook.jpg
role: header
prompt:Basalt plateau edge overlooking a vast valley bristling with waist-high faceted black crystal spires arranged in unnervingly precise geometric rows; a ruler-straight corridor of bare earth cuts through the center, three small travelers silhouetted at the rim for scale. Faint violet luminescence refracts within the crystal field while thin steam threads rise from hairline cracks; tough low red flowers cling between shards, chemical haze softening the far slope. Distant volcanic fissure-glow provides low orange underlight through the haze, violet refractions edge-highlight the nearest facets, shadows fall ink-black between rows. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, slight haze bloom. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: chemical-haze-srietz.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "A su lado, Srietz se había cubierto la nariz con la bufanda y respiraba en intervalos superficiales y contados.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Eyes watering, squinting into stinging chemical air; cloak travel-worn with grit at the shoulders. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Scarf pulled over nose, breathing shallow and counted, gloved finger pointing. They pause beside a black stone territorial marker and a deliberate fence of geometric crystal posts set like an obsidian border, abstract claw-scored and burned-circle symbols implied but not readable; low red flowers push through the gravel as steam threads curl from hairline cracks. Distant volcanic fissure-glow throws a low orange underlight through the haze; violet refraction from the crystal facets adds cold rim highlights on cheeks and knuckles, mist blooming the contrast. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: elion-senses-watchers.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "—Nos están observando —dijo Elion.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Predatory focus, head tilted as if listening; weight held off the left leg, fingers raised in a silent halt. He stands at point and gestures toward a precise arc of taller faceted black crystals oriented toward the corridor, engineered like lookout arrays; dim heat-veins pulse beneath the black stone and chemical mist clings at shin level. Orange fissure-light leaks up from hairline cracks and rakes his features from below; the crystal arc throws faint violet refractions that edge-highlight the mist and cut cool lines across his cheekbones. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: corridor-through-crystals.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Los cristales se apretaban a ambos lados del camino, su zumbido profundizándose al paso del grupo, y podría jurar que las formaciones se inclinaban hacia dentro, facetas angulándose para captar su calor, como si cada aguja fuera una mano extendiéndose hacia algo que deseaba tocar.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Shoulders tight, eyes locked forward; lips slightly parted tasting metallic chemical air, one hand forced loose at his side after a single thumb-to-index tap. He advances down a ruler-straight corridor of bare earth with faceted black crystal needles crowding both sides, rows leaning inward as if reaching for body heat; vibrating dust motes and heat shimmer hint at the deepening hum, steam threads curling from cracks at the path edge. Faint violet luminescence refracts inside the crystal field and paints cold highlights across his face; low orange glow bleeding from subterranean heat-veins adds harsh uplight, mist softening the contrast into haze bloom. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight edge distortion. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: deeper-into-the-garden.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El camino los llevó más profundo dentro del jardín.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Leading with wary momentum, half-glancing to the side without breaking stride. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Refuses to look back, jaw set, hands loose at his sides. [Face_Reference: Srietz] goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, Scarf still raised, head lowered, breath controlled in counted intervals. Rear three-quarter wide shot of the party walking deeper down the maintained ruler-straight corridor through millions of faceted black crystal spires; violet glow pools around their boots, low red flowers punctuate the black ground, distant dark stone formations and taller crystal clusters suggest hidden lookout positions. Violet refraction spills cool light across the path while a faint orange volcanic underglow backlights drifting steam and dust in their wake, haze softening the far rows into blur. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
