1. filename: smoke-vial-shatters.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Split-second decision; Srietz's shaking hand completes the throw as the vial shatters, Drusniel recoils and pivots to run, Elion snaps into motion with eyes locked on the approaching shapes. Wyrmreach badlands of jagged basalt, sparse red scrub, and ground grit disappearing as dense white smoke detonates outward in churning layers; distant Coatly silhouettes flicker inside the haze. Pale overcast daylight backlights the smoke into bright milky scatter, creating hard halo edges around faces and shoulders and soft shadow falloff into darker eddies; flying glass dust and grit catch as sparkling points while turbulent plumes fold over the rock. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: srietz-grabs-arm-no-magic.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "—NO. —Srietz agarró su brazo con fuerza sorprendente—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Urgent restraint; Srietz clamps both hands around Drusniel's forearm to stop the instinctive surge, eyes wide and jaw tight, while Drusniel forces himself to hold still and Elion behind them turns toward the shrieks with combat readiness. Wind-driven dust skates over black stone and scrubby red plants, packs and straps tugging at sleeves as the moment hangs on whether they reveal themselves. Flat cold overcast daylight from above creates soft shadowless fill, picking out sweat sheen as small specular highlights on skin and grit on fabric; the background falls into grey haze with minimal contrast. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight motion blur on gripping hands, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: coatly-confused-in-smoke.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Srietz arrojó el vial.")
prompt:Mid-action chaos; the vial leaves Srietz's hands as the first wave of smoke rolls low and heavy over jagged ground, turning the air opaque while Coatly shapes flit and collide blindly inside the whiteout. Overcast daylight diffused through dense smoke creates bright milky backscatter with soft-edged shadows; nearer eddies reveal sharp basalt texture and suspended glass dust as sparkling points, with turbulence folding and shearing into layered plumes. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: run-through-choking-smoke.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Corrieron.")
prompt:Frantic escape through choking smoke; three figures sprint past twisted stone and low scrub with eyes watering and mouths covered, clothing snapping in the wind as they follow the only line that keeps them upright. The smoke wall glows white behind them and hides the hunters, revealing only broken silhouettes and sudden impacts when something hits rock. Pale daylight backlights the smoke into a luminous sheet and throws soft silhouettes forward; dust and micro-particles glitter briefly in brighter bands then vanish into darker eddies, with wind-sheared plumes tearing sideways. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: obsidian-cave-after-flight.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Se lanzaron adentro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Srietz, Elion]. Collapse into silence; the three stand close in the obsidian cave entrance catching harsh ragged breath, ash-smeared and shaking, Srietz staring at the empty vial case in his hands like it cost him weeks. Reflective black cave walls shimmer with damp highlights, and the mouth behind them is a darker cut against bright smoke outside, implying safety only because the Coatly refuse to cross. Smoke-lit daylight outside acts as a cold softbox that spills inward, turning wet stone into glossy reflections and adding a thin rim along shoulders; deep interior falls to near-black with dense shadow retention and a faint halation at the cave mouth edge. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
