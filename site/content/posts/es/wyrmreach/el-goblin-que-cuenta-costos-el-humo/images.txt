1. filename: smoke-vial-shatters.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, split-second decision; Srietz's shaking hand completes the throw as the vial shatters, Drusniel recoils and pivots to run, and Elion snaps into motion with eyes locked on the approaching shapes. In the Wyrmreach badlands, jagged black rock and sparse red flora vanish as dense white smoke detonates outward, swallowing the ground and turning the air into churning layers; distant Coatly silhouettes flicker and stutter inside the haze. Pale overcast daylight backlights the smoke into a bright wall with hard backscatter around faces and shoulders, while nearer eddies stay darker and reveal grit and flying glass specks as they catch the light. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur in the smoke turbulence, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: srietz-grabs-arm-no-magic.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "—NO. —Srietz agarró su brazo con fuerza sorprendente—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, urgent restraint; Srietz clamps both hands around Drusniel's forearm to stop the instinctive surge, eyes wide and jaw tight as he warns without words, while Drusniel forces himself to hold still and Elion in the background turns toward the shrieks with combat readiness. Wind-driven dust skates over black stone and scrubby red plants as distant shapes close in, the moment balanced on whether they reveal themselves. Flat cold overcast daylight from above and front-left reveals travel grime and sweat sheen and leaves deep shadows under brows, with the far background softened by haze. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slight motion blur on the gripping hands, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: coatly-confused-in-smoke.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Srietz arrojó el vial.")
prompt:Photorealistic, mid-action; Srietz releases the vial with both hands, glass catching a last dull glint before impact as the first wave of smoke rolls low and heavy over jagged ground and turns the air opaque. Coatly shapes flit and collide blindly inside the whiteout, wings and bodies snapping into and out of silhouette as they overshoot, crash, and correct. Overcast daylight diffused through the smoke creates bright milky backscatter and soft-edged shadows, while nearer eddies reveal sharp rock texture and suspended glass dust as sparkling points. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly underexposed, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: run-through-choking-smoke.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Corrieron.")
prompt:Photorealistic, frantic escape through choking smoke; three figures sprint past twisted stone and low scrub with eyes watering and mouths covered, clothing snapping in the wind as they follow the only line that keeps them upright. Behind them the smoke wall glows white and hides the hunters, revealing only broken silhouettes and sudden impacts when something hits rock. Pale daylight backlights the smoke into a luminous sheet and throws soft silhouettes forward, while dust and micro-particles glitter briefly then vanish as they pass through brighter bands. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, pronounced motion blur, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: obsidian-cave-after-flight.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Se lanzaron adentro.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Srietz, Elion] Photorealistic, collapse into silence; the three stand close in the obsidian cave entrance catching harsh ragged breath, ash-smeared and shaking, while Srietz stares at the empty vial case in his hands like it cost him weeks. The cave's reflective black walls shimmer with bounced light and damp highlights, and the mouth behind them is a darker cut against the bright smoke outside, suggesting safety only because the Coatly refuse to cross it. The smoke-lit daylight outside acts as a cold softbox that spills inward and turns wet stone into glossy reflections, with a thin rim of brightness along shoulders while the deeper cave falls to near-black. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation at the cave mouth, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
