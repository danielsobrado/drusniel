1. filename: wake-after-the-escape.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, bruised exhaustion; eyes opening to a world that never truly morning-brightens, breath shallow and controlled. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Awake and watching, uncomfortably calm, head tilted slightly wrong as if listening for pursuit. In a jagged rock shelter off the road, Drusniel wakes slumped against cold stone with grit smeared on his clothing; Elion sits a few meters away, still as a guard, while far behind a faint smoke plume marks where the caravan burned. The Wyrmreach twilight has brightened by a degree, a grey-red wash that fills shadows, and the distant fire adds a weak orange edge that barely reaches the rocks, catching in dust motes. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, slightly underexposed, natural texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: you-are-a-person.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "—Eres una persona.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Photorealistic, stunned stillness like a hit to the chest; throat working before words come. [Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Simple certainty, no pity, no fear; eyes steady as he says the obvious. Close two-shot framed by jagged stone as ash haze drifts in the air and both men sit on rough rock and black grit, the world quiet after running. The shifted twilight provides flat cold fill, while a faint orange reflection from distant fire warms one edge of their faces and makes breath vapor and dust visible. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, background softly out of focus, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: elion-offers-a-hand.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Elion extendió una mano—.")
prompt:Photorealistic close-up on hands: Elion’s long-fingered grey hand extends, palm open in invitation, and a scraped blue-ash skinned hand takes it, knuckles dirty and raw; the grip is firm, deciding, with fine ash and grit packed into skin creases. Soft twilight fills the frame with cold grey-red, while a weak warm edge from distant fire catches on fingernails and highlights dust on the skin. Canon EOS R5 100mm f/2.8 Macro Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, natural skin texture. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: elion-stands-wrongly.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Elion se levantó, su cuerpo desplegándose de maneras que hacían que los ojos de Drusniel quisieran desviarse.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, Photorealistic, calm as he rises; body unfolding with subtle wrongness, joints bending just a fraction too far. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Watching with wary attention, eyes tracking movements he doesn't want to see. Elion stands in the cramped rock shelter, stone teeth framing him, while Drusniel remains seated against the wall; the space feels too small for something that moves like that. Cold twilight fills the shadows, and a faint orange pulse from far-off flames paints a thin rim along Elion’s profile and the nearest rock edge. Sony A7R IV 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: walking-east-together.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Delante de ellos, el resplandor volcánico pulsaba contra el cielo crepuscular.")
prompt:Photorealistic wide rear shot of two figures leaving the rock shelter and walking east across hostile broken ground toward a pulsing volcanic glow on the horizon; far behind them, smoke still rises from the ruined caravan as a thin dark column. The sky stays red-grey and starless, the volcanic glow throws low orange highlights on basalt ridges and on the edges of their cloaks, and dust drifts through the air in shallow layers. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.8 Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible, atmospheric haze, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
