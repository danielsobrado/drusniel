## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:03-00:05] A phosphorescent pulse brightens and the carved lines flash into visibility; his eyes widen as he reads without moving his lips, then he shifts his hand to keep the angle.
[00:05-00:08] He jerks back, presses a palm to his sternum as if the Beacon burns through cloth, then looks into the corridor as if expecting something to notice; after a beat, he leans back in despite himself.

Audio: fingertip scrape on obsidian, dust fall, water drips, controlled breathing, faint low hum from the Beacon, distant rock tick. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
