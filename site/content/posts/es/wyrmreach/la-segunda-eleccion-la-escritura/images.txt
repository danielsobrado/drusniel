1. filename: cannot-leave-the-writing-alone.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Exhausted fixation, eyes rimmed, brow tight; fingertips traced raw, kneeling too close to the wall. He returns again and again to the deepest obsidian chamber, dragging his fingers across carved grooves and broken fragments, trying to piece meaning from scars in black glass; dust and moisture cling to the cuts and vanish when he shifts his hand away. Faint cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence gives weak raking light that makes the grooves flare silver for an instant, while everything else stays swallowed in black reflections. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight halation, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: fragments-and-survival-notes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Pero no toda la escritura era cósmica.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro detail of obsidian wall carvings: precise scholar-cut grooves scattered like a broken library, sections violently gouged out, and lower down hurried scratch marks cut shallow and uneven by a different hand; dust and condensation bead in the lines and catch light only at certain angles. Cyan-green ceiling phosphorescence skims across the black polish, creating razor specular highlights along groove edges and deep shadow inside gouges, with faint ghost reflections in the surrounding stone. Canon EOS R5 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: dual-nature-as-a-key.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel se sentó en la oscuridad por mucho tiempo, pensando.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Staring into nothing, jaw tight, eyes unfocused; one hand pressed to sternum as if feeling heat through cloth. He sits on the cave floor with his back to black-glass stone, letting the fragments settle into a pattern he doesn't want, listening to water ticks and distant rock while the carved wall sits just out of reach in the dark. The ceiling's cyan phosphorescence pulses faintly, painting soft top-light over slack hands and casting long falloff into black; a brief blue-white leak from the Beacon under fabric adds a cold edge to his knuckles. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: srietz-warns-about-knowing.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "—Srietz dirá esto: el conocimiento es peso.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz] Eyes calculating, posture curled and guarded; mouth flat as he delivers the warning. [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Burdened and restless, gaze flicking away, shoulders tight. Back in the main chamber, Srietz watches Drusniel and speaks about knowledge as weight while the phosphorescent pulse marks time behind them, the cave air still and hungry; Drusniel's fingers keep worrying at nothing as if trying to rub ink off the mind. Cold cyan ceiling glow gives weak top-light that leaves hard shadows under brows and turns wet obsidian into dim mirrors, reflections jittering with each pulse. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: counting-hours-and-waiting.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Drusniel se acomodó contra la pared y continuó contando horas.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Eyes fixed on the cave mouth, lips counting; posture rigid from hours without sleep. He settles against the wall and resumes counting time, willing Elion to return, while the carved fragments and gouged-out warnings disappear into shadow behind him and the cave keeps pulsing indifferent light. Slow ceiling phosphorescence throws soft cyan top-light that skims wet stone and catches on condensation, leaving the entrance a black cutout and his face half in shadow. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight vignetting, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
