1. filename: cave-safe-until-dawn.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Wary relief; Srietz collapsed against the wall breathing hard, Elion crouched in a posture that reads both rest and readiness, Drusniel standing with listening stillness as if the stone is speaking. They shelter in a cavern that feels inhabited by something large and curious rather than hungry; the air holds a presence that keeps the Coatly away. Faint violet mineral luminescence from seams in wet vesicular volcanic stone provides cold low fill, catching moisture as glossy highlights and revealing pore-like rock texture; a thin pre-dawn grey leak from a high fissure adds a pale rim on shoulders and turns drifting dust into soft points of light while the far chamber falls into layered black. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: srietz-says-rest.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Estamos seguros hasta el amanecer.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . Exhausted control; slumped against cold stone, breath ragged, forcing calm as he says they are safe until dawn, ears angled to listen for threats that stop at the cavern edge. Tight portrait with damp volcanic rock behind him, grit stuck to sleeves and fingers, a faint tremor in hands he pretends is not there. Violet mineral glow from wall seams lifts detail from below and turns wet stone into glossy specular streaks; the faintest pre-dawn grey from the fissure behind adds a thin rim along cheek and ear, with tiny reflections visible in wet eyes and on skin moisture. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: drusniel-calculates-the-bargain.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Drusniel permaneció de pie, observando al goblin con ojos calculadores.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Calculating eyes and refusal to relax; dust and grit still clinging from the run, breath controlled as he weighs a bargain like distance and risk. He stands over Srietz in the cave hush, listening past words to the presence in the stone. Cold violet luminescence from mineral seams provides low uplight that catches wet rock texture and paints thin highlights along jaw and knuckles; the thin pre-dawn leak from a high fissure adds a weak back rim and turns suspended dust into a dim halo behind him. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: elion-listens-to-terms.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Elion se asentó en una posición agachada que de alguna manera sugería tanto relajación como preparación.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Guarded practicality; crouched low, eyes tracking every term and every shift of Srietz's hands. Uneven damp cave floor around him with grit and small stone chips pressed into the ground; the air feels watched but not threatened, as if the cavern is tolerating them. Violet mineral glow pools low and cold across rock and fabric edges, creating interactive highlights on moisture and a cool sheen on stone; the faint pre-dawn rim from the fissure behind cuts a thin line along shoulder and knee while deep shadows stay dense beyond the pool of light. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: we-have-a-deal.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "—Tenemos un trato —dijo Drusniel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel, Elion]. Terms accepted without warmth; Drusniel gives a small final nod, Srietz flashes a quick sharp business smile, Elion watches from his crouch without blinking. The bargain locks in inside the cavern's temporary safety; outside shrieks are distant and muffled, dawn implied by a thin grey line at the high fissure slowly brightening. Violet mineral luminescence provides cold fill that catches on wet rock and turns dust motes into faint points; the growing pre-dawn leak adds a pale rim separating faces from cave dark, with soft halation around the brightest seam. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
