1. filename: elion-whispers-northeast.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion, Drusniel, Srietz] Photorealistic, predawn urgency; Elion kneels close to dying embers with unfocused eyes and a too-steady certainty, Drusniel jolts upright from shallow sleep instantly awake, and Srietz holds a crouch in the shadows with listening stillness aimed at the cave mouth. Cramped obsidian-and-basalt shelter with damp black stone, ash grit on the floor, and travel packs half-open beside the fire, with a faint wrongness in the wall sheen as if something just shifted under the surface. Warm ember light from low center rakes upward across faces and wet rock, while cold blue dawn leaking in from the cave mouth adds a thin rim along shoulders and turns the far chamber into layered black. Canon EOS R5 24mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation around embers, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: elion-distant-eyes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "—Los ojos de Elion estaban extraños—distantes, desenfocados, viendo algo que no estaba frente a él—.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion] Photorealistic, distant and unsettled; brow furrowed and pupils slightly unfocused as if he is listening to a memory instead of the cave around him, lips parted on a confession he cannot explain. Tight portrait in the predawn cave with ember smoke and wet black stone falling to soft bokeh behind him, condensation beading on the rock and catching stray light. Warm ember glow from low left paints one side of his face in orange, while cold dawn spill from the cave mouth rims the other cheek and ear in blue and deepens the shadow around his far eye. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: srietz-warns-about-knowledge.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Importa porque el conocimiento inexplicado es peligroso.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel] Photorealistic, practical suspicion; Srietz speaks low with a hard stare and a clawed finger half-raised in warning, while Drusniel listens in profile with jaw set, weighing the cost of knowledge he cannot explain. They huddle close in the cramped cave circle with ember smoke drifting between them, ash on sleeves, and damp obsidian walls reflecting small highlights like wet glass. Ember light from below warms knuckles and throws sharp moving shadows up onto cheekbones, while the cold dawn leak from the cave mouth backlights the smoke into a thin blue haze. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur on the pointing hand, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: something-moves-in-the-wall.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La cosa en las paredes de la caverna se movió, su presencia retrocediendo mientras el amanecer se acercaba afuera.")
prompt:Photorealistic macro detail of slick obsidian cave wall: wet black stone with tiny pores, hairline fractures, and ash dust resting on a narrow ledge; a subtle bulge travels under the surface like a breath passing through sealed stone, making the grit tremble. Ember light glints warm orange across the wet sheen from low left, while the approaching dawn cools the shadows to blue and reveals micro-scratches in the rock. Sony A7R IV 100mm macro Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: leave-before-it-returns.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Hora de moverse.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Elion] Photorealistic, moving before courage fails; Drusniel stands at the cave mouth with gear cinched tight and a listening stillness, while Elion holds a small sad smile that reads like fear he refuses to name. They step toward Wyrmreach badlands of black volcanic stone and sparse red flora, with their embers dying behind them and Srietz already a low silhouette scanning ahead. Pale dawn light floods in from outside, flattening the landscape in cold grey-blue, while the last warm ember glow from behind adds a weak orange edge along cloaks and hands. Canon EOS R5 35mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
