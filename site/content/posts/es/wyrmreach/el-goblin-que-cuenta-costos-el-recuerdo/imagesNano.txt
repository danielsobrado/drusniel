1. filename: elion-whispers-northeast.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion, Drusniel, Srietz]. Predawn urgency; Elion kneels close to dying embers with unfocused eyes and a fixed certainty, Drusniel jolts upright from shallow sleep, Srietz holds a crouch in the shadows listening toward the cave mouth. Cramped obsidian-and-basalt shelter with damp vesicular volcanic stone, ash grit on the floor, travel packs half-open by the fire, and a faint wrongness in the wall sheen as if something just shifted under the surface. Ember coals provide warm orange uplight that catches the undersides of cheekbones and knuckles and paints glossy specular streaks across wet rock; cold blue dawn spill from the cave mouth adds a thin rim on shoulders and turns drifting smoke into a pale blue haze with interactive scattering over the black stone. Sony A7R V 24mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, subtle halation, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: elion-distant-eyes.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "â€”Los ojos de Elion estaban extraÃ±osâ€”distantes, desenfocados, viendo algo que no estaba frente a Ã©lâ€”.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Elion]. Distant and unsettled; brow furrowed, pupils slightly unfocused as if listening to a memory, lips parted on a confession he cannot explain. Tight portrait in the predawn cave with wet black stone and ember smoke falling into soft bokeh, condensation beads clinging to the rock behind him. Warm ember glow from low left creates orange highlights under the cheekbone and along the nose bridge; cold dawn spill from the cave mouth rims the far cheek and ear in blue, with tiny wet reflections visible in the eyes and on skin moisture while deep shadows stay dense. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, shallow depth of field, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 2:3. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: srietz-warns-about-knowledge.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Importa porque el conocimiento inexplicado es peligroso.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Srietz, Drusniel]. Practical suspicion; Srietz speaks low with a hard stare and a clawed finger half-raised in warning, Drusniel listens in profile with jaw set, weighing the cost of knowledge he cannot explain. Tight cave circle with ember smoke drifting between them, ash on sleeves, and damp obsidian walls reflecting small highlights like wet glass. Ember light from below warms knuckles and paints orange highlights along fingers and jaw, reflected as glossy streaks on wet basalt; cold dawn backlight from the cave mouth turns the smoke into a thin blue haze and adds a clean rim that separates profiles from the cave dark. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, slight motion blur on the pointing hand, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: something-moves-in-the-wall.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "La cosa en las paredes de la caverna se moviÃ³, su presencia retrocediendo mientras el amanecer se acercaba afuera.")
prompt:Macro realism; wet obsidian stone with pore-like pits and hairline fractures, ash dust resting on a narrow ledge as a subtle bulge travels under the surface like a breath passing through sealed rock, making the grit tremble and slide. Ember glints from low left create warm orange specular highlights that skate across the wet sheen; cold dawn spill cools the shadows to blue and reveals micro-scratches and moisture beads with crisp edge reflections. Sony A7R V 100mm f/2.8 GM Kodak Ektar 100, film grain visible, slight vignetting, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: leave-before-it-returns.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Hora de moverse.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel, Elion]. Moving before courage fails; Drusniel stands at the cave mouth with gear cinched tight and listening stillness, Elion holds a small sad smile that reads like fear he refuses to name. They step toward Wyrmreach badlands of black volcanic stone and sparse red flora, embers dying behind them and a low silhouette already scanning ahead. Pale dawn light floods the exterior in cold grey-blue, flattening the terrain; the last warm ember glow from behind adds a weak orange edge on cloaks and hands, with dust motes catching both colors as tiny points in the air and reflections shimmering on wet rock. Sony A7R V 35mm f/1.4 GM Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slight lens flare, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
