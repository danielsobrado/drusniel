## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Drusniel absorbs the words. Cold spreads across his expression — a slow constriction, jaw locking, eyes going distant. The violet glow from the crystal pillar behind pulses once, casting shifting highlights across his face.
[00:03-00:05] His eyes refocus on Talryn's face. Recognition passes between them — not warmth, but understanding. She knows what lives in his head. Volcanic haze drifts between them.
[00:05-00:08] Drusniel exhales. His hand moves to his temple, touches it once, drops. Talryn watches the gesture with the stillness of someone confirming a suspicion. The crystal pillar's violet glow fades.

Static camera. Tight framing.
Audio: wind through crystal formations, faint vibrational hum from the pillar, distant volcanic rumble. A single exhale. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
