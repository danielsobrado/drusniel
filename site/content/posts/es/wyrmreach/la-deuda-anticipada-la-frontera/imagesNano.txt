1. filename: crystal-border-pillar.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn]. Setting her pack down, back to camera. A lone black crystal pillar juts from volcanic soil marking a territorial boundary. Crystalline lattice with subsurface scattering, faceted surface with internal refraction. Beyond it a flat expanse of grey basalt with pale lichen stretches to the horizon. Dense black crystal formations fade into the distance behind the pillar, three travelers approach. Dull violet glow from the crystal pillar casts interactive violet highlights on the surrounding volcanic soil and Talryn's pack. Orange volcanic haze on the horizon reflects off the flat basalt expanse ahead. Shadows tinged violet near the pillar, shifting to amber at distance. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8, Kodak Ektar 100, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: talryn-delivers-crystal-vial.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Se lo tendio a Drusniel.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Talryn]. Arm extended, offering a small sealed container with professional detachment. [Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Receiving, guarded expression, fingers not yet touching the container. Guide extends a small black crystal container that glows faintly warm toward the drow, both framed by the last crystal formation at the territorial border. The container's warm glow provides interactive light between their hands, casting orange-amber highlights on wrists and fingers from the point of exchange. Crystalline lattice of the container visible, subsurface warmth emanating from within. Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8, Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: nyxara-warning-delivery.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Lady Nyxara dice: la cosa que llevas en la cabeza quiere tu cuerpo. Las antiguas siempre quieren eso.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Cold spreading through his expression, the look of someone whose secret has been stripped bare. Subtle physical recoil. [Face_Reference: Talryn]. Watching with quiet recognition, no surprise in her posture. Drow reacts to devastating words while guide observes, the last black crystal pillar behind them. Violet glow from the crystal pillar backlights both figures with interactive violet rim light along their shoulders and hair, cold against the warm volcanic haze that fills the distance. Shadows on their faces tinged violet from the crystal, warm amber from the distant volcanic glow. Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM, Kodak Portra 400, slightly underexposed. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: talryn-walks-into-crystals.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "El terreno se la trago y no quedo nada que observar.")
prompt:Female silhouette walking away between rows of black crystal formations, three travelers watch her go from the border marker. The crystal field stretches deep, the sense of a door closing. Crystalline lattice formations with subsurface scattering line her path. Faint violet bioluminescence from the crystals casts interactive violet highlights along her receding silhouette, dimming as she moves deeper. Light refracts through crystal facets creating scattered violet points on the ground of her path. Volcanic darkness absorbs her form at distance. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8, Kodak Portra 400, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: group-walks-northeast.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Caminaron al noreste hacia un territorio que no pertenecia a nadie y no prometia nada.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel]drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, . Leading, shoulders set with determination. [Face_Reference: Srietz]goblin with dark grayish-green skin and pointed ears, . At his side, ears up scanning the emptiness. [Face_Reference: Elion]pale bluish-white skin with pointed elf ears and red war paint, . Walking point ahead, scanning the horizon. Three figures from behind walking northeast into flat barren basalt with pale lichen and steam-leaking fissures. Vesicular basalt underfoot, porous and heat-fractured. Behind them a row of dark crystal teeth marks the border, emptiness ahead. Flat grey light from overcast volcanic sky washes the scene with muted tones, faint orange glow from distant fissures on the horizon casts interactive warm highlights on the steam columns rising from cracks in the basalt. Shadows diffuse and directionless under the flat sky. Sony A7R V 35mm f/2.8, Kodak Portra 400, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2. Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
