1. filename: maris-wakes-devastated.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Xandor] Maris lies on cold wet ground, slowly opening bloodshot eyes. Blood runs from both nostrils, face pale and drawn with exhaustion. Xandor kneels beside her with hands on her temples. Yellow grass and grey sky above. Cold flat daylight from overcast sky falling on her devastated face. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "Lo vi.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Dulint] [Face_Reference: Eldric] [Face_Reference: Balin] [Face_Reference: Xandor] Maris propped up sitting on wet ground, trembling, forcing words through a raw throat. Blood still wet on her upper lip and chin. Four companions lean in close to hear her barely audible voice, low hills with dry grass around them. Diffused grey daylight from overcast sky, cold and even across all faces. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Nada en él es humano.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Dulint] [Face_Reference: Balin] [Face_Reference: Eldric] [Face_Reference: Xandor] Dulint frowns deeply, Balin looks bewildered, Eldric calculating, Xandor places a steadying hand on the woman's shoulder. Four travelers exchange confused glances on a northern hillside clearing. Cold flat overcast daylight, grey and shadowless across their faces.

4. filename: beacon-glows-in-response.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Como si hubiera encontrado lo que buscaba.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Dulint] Maris's bloody hand points at a heavy pack on the ground where the artifact inside has gone completely still and dark for the first time. Dulint holds the pack, looking down at it with new understanding and dread. The absence of the usual pulsing light leaves only cold northern daylight on their faces. Cold flat overcast daylight, no warm tones, the artifact's darkness conspicuous. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Kodak Portra 400, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Entonces lo encontramos antes de que terminen.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Dulint] [Face_Reference: Eldric] [Face_Reference: Balin] [Face_Reference: Xandor] Maris sits up with blood drying on her face, fierce certainty in bloodshot eyes. Dulint stands with jaw set in determination. Five travelers united on a northern hillside under cold overcast sky stretching north. Flat grey daylight from heavy cloud cover, cold and unforgiving across the group. Sony A7R IV 35mm f/2.8 Kodak Portra 400, film grain visible, slightly out of focus background. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
