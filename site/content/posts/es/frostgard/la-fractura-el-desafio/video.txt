## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] Eldric steps into the grey-white current first, rope tightening around his waist. The line snaps taut behind him as the others follow, boots searching for rock through the pull of the water.
[00:03-00:05] A foothold slips — Balin’s shoulder dips and the rope jerks hard. Dulint braces, leaning backward with the pack held high as spray blasts into faces and breath turns to white vapor.
[00:05-00:08] They regain rhythm. Eldric signals with a sharp hand motion and drives them forward; one by one they clear the deepest section and stagger onto the far bank, soaked and shaking, rope still tight until the last person is out.

Handheld tracking alongside the rope line, staying low to the water.
Audio: roaring current, rock scrape under boots, rope fibers creaking, sharp breath and grunts, splashes and spray, wet cloth slapping, river hiss. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
