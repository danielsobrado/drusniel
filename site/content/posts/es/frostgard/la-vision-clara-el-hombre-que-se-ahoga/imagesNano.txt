1. filename: vision-boat-black-water.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Drusniel crouches in a small wooden boat, gripping the sides, one hand reaching desperately into the water to row. Expression of raw survival focus.
Environment: Nightmare-black water moves with wrong physics, thick and slow like oil, around the boat. Void-dark sky with no stars. Sickly greenish luminescence rises from below the water surface, green bioluminescence casts interactive upward glow onto the wooden hull and Drusniel's face and arms from beneath.
Camera: Sony A7R V 24mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible. Aspect: 3:2
Material: Black water rendered as non-Newtonian fluid, high viscosity, separate bioluminescence source below surface.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

2. filename: drowning-man-face-revealed.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "En el reflejo verdoso y distorsionado, Maris vio el rostro completo por primera vez.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Drusniel's face emerges from dark vision-water, expression caught between terror and fierce determination. Nightmare-black water reflects his features with distortion.
Environment: Deep void water surrounding the face. Sickly green bioluminescence rising from deep below the water casts interactive highlights from underneath onto jaw, cheekbones, and brow ridge, green light refracts through water droplets on skin.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field. Aspect: 2:3
Material: Vision-water is non-Newtonian fluid with high surface tension, distorting reflections with viscous movement.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

3. filename: maris-feels-his-emotions.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Miedo animal en el estomago, en los musculos de los muslos que se tensaban preparados para correr sin tener adonde ir, en la mandibula apretada hasta que los dientes chirriaban.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Split composition: Maris's face on one side, Drusniel's on the other, both wearing identical expressions of raw animal fear, jaws clenched. Threads of amber light connect them between the two halves.
Environment: Cold northern hill light fading behind Maris, volcanic green glow behind Drusniel. Amber threads of connection provide warm interactive light between the two faces, amber glow reflects off skin on both sides, green bioluminescence illuminates Drusniel's half from below, cold grey overcast light falls on Maris's half from above.
Camera: Sony A7R V 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare on the amber threads. Aspect: 3:2
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

4. filename: entity-encounter-reverb.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Algo enorme se movia bajo la superficie.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, Drusniel rigid in his small boat, body tense with awareness. Massive unseen shapes distort the black water surface beneath him, scale dwarfing the boat. Expression of controlled terror.
Environment: Void-dark expanse of black water stretching in all directions. Sickly green luminescence intensifying from below, green bioluminescence surges upward from the depths casting shifting interactive shadows across Drusniel's face and the boat hull. Amber light crackling around the boat's edges reflects off the viscous water surface.
Camera: Sony A7R V 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain not visible, not perfectly exposed. Aspect: 3:2
Material: Black water surface distorts with massive subsurface displacement, non-Newtonian fluid bulging upward in slow heavy swells.
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography

5. filename: moment-of-connection.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "El la veia.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] drow with blueish ash skin color and subtle yellow eyes, [Face_Reference: Maris] Drusniel in his small boat on black water looks upward with shocked recognition. Above him through layers of dark water and void, Maris's face looks down with equal shock. A thread of warm amber light connects their eyes across the barrier between worlds.
Environment: Absolute darkness surrounding both figures. Amber connection-light glows between the two figures, amber thread casts warm interactive highlights on both faces simultaneously, light refracts through the layered void between them creating subtle prismatic diffusion.
Camera: Sony A7R V 85mm f/1.4 GM Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare on the amber thread, film grain not visible. Aspect: 2:3
Negative: Plastic skin, wax figure, 3D render, smooth shading, airbrushed, beauty filter, symmetrical face, perfect teeth, clean armor, bright colors, floating artifacts, extra limbs, glamour lighting, fashion photography
