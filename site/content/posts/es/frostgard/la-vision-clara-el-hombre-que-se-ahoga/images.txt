1. filename: vision-boat-black-water.jpg
role: header
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Drusniel crouches in a small wooden boat, gripping the sides, one hand reaching desperately into the water to row. Nightmare-black water moves with wrong physics, thick and slow like oil, around the boat. Sickly greenish luminescence rises from below the water surface, casting upward glow on the boat and figure. Sony A7R IV 24mm f/2.0 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, void-dark sky with no stars. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

2. filename: drowning-man-face-revealed.jpg
role: mid_01 (placed after sentence "En el reflejo verdoso y distorsionado, Maris vio el rostro completo por primera vez.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Drusniel's face emerges from dark vision-water, expression caught between terror and fierce determination. Nightmare-black water reflects his features with distortion. Sickly green bioluminescence rising from deep below the water, illuminating his face from underneath. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, natural skin with pores, shallow depth of field. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

3. filename: maris-feels-his-emotions.jpg
role: mid_02 (placed after sentence "Miedo animal en el estómago, en los músculos de los muslos que se tensaban preparados para correr sin tener adónde ir, en la mandíbula apretada hasta que los dientes chirriaban.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Maris] [Face_Reference: Drusniel] Split composition: Maris's face on one side, Drusniel's on the other, both wearing identical expressions of raw animal fear, jaws clenched. Threads of amber light connect them between the two halves. Cold northern hill light fading behind Maris, volcanic green glow behind Drusniel. Amber threads of connection providing warm light between the two faces. Canon EOS R5 50mm f/1.8 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare on the amber threads. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

4. filename: entity-encounter-reverb.jpg
role: mid_03 (placed after sentence "Algo enorme se movía bajo la superficie.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] Drusniel rigid in his small boat, body tense with awareness. Massive unseen shapes distort the black water surface beneath him, scale dwarfing the boat. Sickly green luminescence intensifying from below, amber light crackling around the boat's edges. Green bioluminescence surging upward from the depths, casting shifting shadows on Drusniel. Sony A7R IV 16mm f/2.8 Cinestill 800T, film grain visible, not perfectly exposed. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.

5. filename: moment-of-connection.jpg
role: mid_04 (placed after sentence "Él la veía.")
prompt:[Face_Reference: Drusniel] [Face_Reference: Maris] Drusniel in his small boat on black water looks upward with shocked recognition. Above him through layers of dark water and void, Maris's face looks down with equal shock. A thread of warm amber light connects their eyes across the barrier between worlds. Amber connection-light glowing between the two figures, surrounded by darkness. Canon EOS R5 85mm f/1.4 Cinestill 800T, subtle lens flare on the amber thread, film grain visible. No text, no watermarks, no frames, no borders. No 3D render, no illustration, no cartoon, no anime, no CGI. No extra limbs, no distorted hands.
