## Veo 3 Prompt

[00:00-00:03] The amber thread of light between them pulses — once, twice — growing brighter. Drusniel looks upward from the boat with shocked recognition, hand reaching. Above through layers of void, Maris's face clarifies with equal shock.
[00:03-00:05] The thread intensifies. Their fingers strain toward each other across the impossible gap. The black water around the boat glows sickly green from below, reacting to the connection. The boat rocks.
[00:05-00:08] Something vast moves beneath the water. The surface distorts. The amber thread shudders, frays. Drusniel's expression shifts from recognition to alarm — not for himself, but for her. The connection snaps. Darkness floods in.

Static camera, slowly tightening.
Audio: deep resonant hum building, crackling amber energy, water lapping against wood, sudden bass impact at the snap. No music. No dialogue. No subtitles.
Photorealistic, cinematic, slightly grainy.
