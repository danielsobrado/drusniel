"No."

Drusniel stood in Zaelar's study, hands loose at his sides. Three days since the map. Three days of counting heartbeats and weighing arguments and trying to find solid ground in a landscape that kept shifting.

"No to Wyrmreach?" Zaelar set down his tea without apparent concern. "Or no to the courier offer specifically?"

"Both. I'm not leaving. Not now." Drusniel kept his voice steady. "My family needs me here."

"Your family doesn't know you exist anymore." The words were gentle. Almost kind. "They see an empty chair at dinner and a closed door at night. They don't know what you can do. What you've become."

"Then I'll show them. When I'm ready." He met Zaelar's gaze. "You said the power is real. You said I'm rare. Teach me more. Let me become strong enough to protect them without crossing to a death realm."

Zaelar studied him for a long moment. No irritation this time—just calculation, patient and cold.

"Of course." He inclined his head. "The offer stands when you're ready. Power has no timeline."

The relief surprised Drusniel. He'd expected argument. Pressure. Instead, Zaelar simply reached for a text on his desk.

"Shall we continue? I have a new exercise for air sensing. More difficult than before."

*I said no,* Drusniel thought. *That means I'm in control.*

The thought felt true. He wanted it to be true.

"Let's continue," he said.

The walk back to Umbra'kor felt wrong.

Drusniel had made this journey dozens of times now—surface passages connecting Zaelar's tower to the underground city. The route was familiar. The pressure changes, the shifting light, the specific moment when fungal glow replaced gray sky.

Tonight, something had changed.

He felt it before he could name it. A disturbance in the air patterns. Movement where there should be stillness. His new sense kept triggering at the edges of awareness—presence, displacement, something moving in the shadows just beyond sight.

*You're imagining things.*

But his assassin training disagreed. The hairs on his neck stood straight. His thumb tapped against his fingers without conscious thought. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

He quickened his pace. The tunnel walls pressed closer. Fungal light cast strange shadows, and every shadow seemed to hold a shape that vanished when he looked directly at it.

The compound entrance appeared ahead. Guards. Safety. Home.

Drusniel didn't run. Running showed fear, and fear invited pursuit. But he walked faster than usual, and he didn't stop looking over his shoulder until he passed through the gate.

The tunnel behind him sat dark and empty.

*Imagining things,* he told himself again.

The words felt hollow.

Shyntara was waiting in the family quarters.

She stood by the window of the common room, silhouetted against fungal light, and she didn't turn when Drusniel entered. But her voice cut through the silence like a blade.

"Where do you go?"

He stopped in the doorway. "Training. I told you."

"You've told me many things." She turned then, and her expression was the one she used when evaluating threats. "You disappear at dawn. You return at dusk. You flinch at sounds that aren't there, and you count things when you think no one is watching."

"I've always counted things."

"Not like this." She crossed the room, stopping an arm's length away. Close enough to grab. Close enough to kill, if she wanted. "Something changed. After the trial. Something is different about you."

"I failed." The words came out harder than he intended. "Everything is different."

"That's not what I mean." Her pale eyes studied him. "You move differently. You react to things before they happen. And you smell like surface air. Like wind and things that grow under sunlight."

Drusniel's pulse quickened. He kept his breathing steady, his expression neutral. Years of living in a house of assassins had taught him that much.

"I go to the upper tunnels sometimes. The surface access points. The air is cleaner there."

"You're lying."

"I'm coping." He held her gaze. "The trial broke something. I'm trying to put it back together. Is that allowed, or do I need your permission?"

The silence stretched between them. Something in Shyntara's expression shifted—not softening exactly, but recalculating.

"Father is worried," she said finally. "About the family. About enemies moving against us. He's too distracted to notice what you're doing, but I'm not."

"Then stop noticing."

"I can't." Her voice dropped lower. "You're my brother. Whatever you've gotten yourself into—"

"I haven't gotten into anything."

"Whatever it is," she continued as if he hadn't spoken, "I will find out. And when I do, you'd better hope it's something I can help with. Because if it's something that threatens this family..."

She left the threat unfinished. She didn't need to finish it.

"I would never threaten this family," Drusniel said.

"No." She moved past him toward the door. "You'd just keep secrets from it. Which is sometimes the same thing."

She left.

Drusniel stood alone in the common room, counting his heartbeats. Eighty-seven. Eighty-eight. Eighty-nine.

The watched feeling from the tunnel hadn't faded. If anything, it felt stronger here—as if something had followed him home and settled into the shadows of his family's compound.

*Something is coming.*

He didn't know what. But he knew, with cold certainty, that the choices he made in the coming days would matter.

Would change things.

Would set events in motion that couldn't be undone.

He went to his room and lay in darkness, waiting for the presence that might or might not be Annariel to reach out.

It was a long time before he slept.
